            "['Besides these , the island of Java , and particularly the country round Batavia , produces many kinds of fruit which were not in season during our stay ; we were also told that apples , strawberries , and many other fruits from Europe , had been planted up in the mountains , and flourished there in great luxuriance . We saw several fruits preserved in sugar , that we did not see recent from the tree , one of which is called Kimkit , and another Boa Atap : and here are several others which are eaten only by the natives , particularly the Kellor , the Guilindina , the Moringa , and the Soccum . The Soccum is of the same kind with the bread-fruit in the South Sea islands , but so much inferior , that if it had not been for the similitude in the outward appearance both of the fruit and the tree , we should not have referred it to that class . These and some others do not merit to be particularly mentioned . The quantity of fruit that is consumed at Batavia is incredible ; but that which is publicly exposed to sale is generally over-ripe . A stranger however may get good fruit in a street called Passar Pissang , which lies north from the great church , and very near it . This street is inhabited by none but Chinese fruit-sellers , who are supplied from the gardens of Gentlemen in the neighbourhood of the town , with such as is fresh , and excellent in its kind , for which however they must be paid more than four times the market price . The town in general is supplied from a considerable distance , where great quantities of land are cultivated merely for the production of fruit . The country people , to whom these lands belong , meet the people of the town at two great markets ; one on Monday , called Passar Sineen ; and the other on Saturday , called Passar Tanabank . These fairs are held at places considerably distant from each other , for the convenience of different districts ; neither of them however are more than five miles distant from Batavia . At these fairs , the best fruit may be bought at the cheapest rate ; and the sight of them to a European is very entertaining . The quantity of fruit is astonishing ; forty or fifty cart loads of the finest pine apples , packed as carelessly as turneps in England , are common , and other fruit in the same profusion . The days however on which these markets are held are ill contrived ; the time between Saturday and Monday is too short , and that between Monday and Saturday too long : great part of what is bought on Monday is always much the worse for keeping before a new stock can be bought , either by the retailer or consumer ; so that for several days in every week there is no good fruit in the hands of any people but the Chinese in Passar Pissang . The inhabitants of this part of India practise a luxury which seems to be but little attended to in other countries ; they are continually burning aromatic woods and resins , and scatter odours round them in a profusion of flowers , possibly as an antidote to the noisome effluvia of their ditches and canals . Of sweet smelling flowers they have a great variety , altogether unknown in Europe , the chief of which I shall briefly describe . 1 . The Champacka , or Michelia Champacca . This grows upon a tree as large as an apple tree , and consists of fifteen long narrow petala , which give it the appearance of being double , though in reality it is not so : its colour is yellow , and much deeper than that of a jonquil , to which it has some resemblance in smell . 2 . The Cananga , or Uvaria Cananga , is a green flower , not at all resembling the blossom of any tree or plant in Europe : it has indeed more the appearance of a bunch of leaves than a flower ; its scent is agreeable , but altogether peculiar to itself . 3 . The Mulatti , or Nyctanthes Sambac . This is well known in English hot-houses by the name of Arabian jessamine : it grows here in the greatest profusion , and its fragrance , like that of all other Indian flowers , though exquisitely pleasing , has not that over-powering strength which distinguishes some of the same sorts in Europe . 4 , 5 . The Combang Caracnassi , and Combang Tonquin , Percularia Glabro . These are small flowers , of the dog \\' s-bane kind , very much resembling each other in shape and smell , highly fragrant , but very different from every product of an English garden . 6 . The Bonga Tanjong , or Mimusops Elengi of Linnaeus . This flower is shaped like a star of seven or eight rays , and is about half an inch in diameter ; it is of a yellowish colour , and has an agreeable smell . Besides these , there is the Sundal Malam , or Polianthes Tuberosa . This flower , being the same with our own tuberose , can have no place among those that are unknown in Europe , but I mention it for its Malay name , which signifies \" Intriguer of the Night , \" and is not inelegantly conceived . The heat of this climate is so great , that few flowers exhale their sweets in the day ; and this in particular , from its total want of scent at that time , and the modesty of its colour , which is white , seems negligent of attracting admirers , but as soon as night comes on , it diffuses its fragrance , and at once compels the attention , and excites the complacency of all who approach it . These are all sold about the streets every evening at sunset , either strung upon a thread , in wreaths of about two feet long , or made up into nosegays of different forms , either of which may be purchased for about a halfpenny . Besides these , there are , in private gardens many other sweet flowers , which are not produced in a sufficient quantity to be brought to market . With a mixture of these flowers , and the leaves of a plant called pandang , cut into small pieces , persons of both sexes fill their hair and their clothes , and with the same mixture indulge a much higher luxury by strewing it on their beds , so that the chamber in which they sleep , breathes the richest and purest of all odours , unallayed by the fumes which cannot but arise where the sleeper lies under two or three blankets and a quilt , for the bed covering here is nothing more than a single piece of fine chintz . Before I close my account of the vegetable productions of this part of India , I must take some notice of the spices Java originally produced none but pepper . This is now sent from hence into Europe to a great value , but the quantity consumed here is very small : the inhabitants use Capsicum , or , as it is called in Europe , Cayan pepper , almost universally in its stead . Cloves and nutmegs , having been monopolized by the Dutch , are become too dear to be plentifully used by the other inhabitants of this country , who are very fond of them . Cloves , although they are said originally to have been the produce of Machian , or Bachian , a small island far to the eastward , and only fifteen miles to the northward of the line , and to have been from thence disseminated by the Dutch , at their first coming into these parts , over all the eastern islands , are now confined to Amboina , and the small isles that lie in its neighbourhood ; the Dutch having , by different treaties of peace between them and the conquered kings of all the other islands , stipulated , that they should have only a certain number of trees in their dominions , and in future quarrels , as a punishment for disobedience and rebellion , lessened the quantity , till at last they left them no claim to any . Nutmegs have in a manner been extirpated in all the islands except their first native soil , Banda , which easily supplies every nation upon earth , and would as easily supply every nation in another globe of the same dimensions , if there was any such to which the industrious Hollander could transport the commodity ; it is , however , certain , that there are a few trees of this spice upon the coast of New Guinea . There may perhaps be both cloves and nutmegs upon other islands to the eastward ; for those , neither the Dutch , nor any other European , seem to think it worth while to examine . The principal tame quadrupeds of this country are horses , cattle , buffalos , sheep , goats , and hogs . The horses are small , never exceeding in size what we call a stout galloway , but they are nimble and spirited , and are reported to have been found here when the Europeans first came round the Cape of Good Hope . The horned cattle are said to be the same species as those in Europe , but they differ so much in appearance , that we were inclined to doubt it : they have indeed the palearia or dewlap , which naturalists make the distinguishing characteristic of the European species , but they certainly are found wild , not only in Java but several of the eastern islands . The slesh of those that we eat at Batavia , had a finer grain than European beef , but it was less juicy , and miserably lean . Buffalos are plenty , but the Dutch never eat them , nor will they drink their milk , being prepossessed with a notion that both are unwholesome , and tend to produce fevers ; though the natives and Chinese eat both , without any injury to their health . The sheep are of the kind which have long ears that hang down , and hair instead of wool : the flesh of these is hard and tough , and in every respect the worst mutton we ever saw : we found here , however , a few Cape sheep , which are excellent , but so dear that we gave five and forty shillings a-piece for four of them , the heaviest of which weighed only five and forty pounds . The goats are not better than the sheep , but the hogs , especially the Chinese breed , are incomparable , and so fat , that the purchaser agrees for the lean separately . The butcher , who is always a Chinese , without the least scruple cuts off as much of the fat as he is desired , and afterwards sells it to his countrymen , who melt it down , and eat it instead of butter with their rice : but notwithstanding the excellence of this pork , the Dutch are so strongly prejudiced in favour of every thing that comes from their native country , that they eat only of the Dutch breed , which are here sold as much dearer than the Chinese , as the Chinese are sold dearer than the Dutch in Europe . Spanish Mackril are in shape and colour like our Mackril , but larger : They are three Foot or three and half long , and nine or ten Inches about , and they also are generally esteemed very excellent Fish . The Ray is a flat Fish , like Skate , and I have seen three sorts of them ; viz . the Stingray , the Raspray and the Whipray . The Stingray and Rasp | ray are much a like in shape ; but the former has three or four strong sharp Prickles , near two Inches long , at the Root of its Tail , which are said to be very venomous , but the rest of his Skin is smooth . The Raspray has a rough knotty Skin wherewith Rasps are made : the Skins of the largest are so rough , that the Spaniards in some Places grate their Cassavy with them , which is a Root very common all over the West-Indies ; and of which the Spaniards and English frequently make their Bread ; but the fairest Skins are used to cover Surgeons Instrument Cases , and other such fine Things ; but of late they are counterfeited . I have been told that in Turkey Asses Skins are stamped with small hard Seeds , which gives them Impressions like Raspray . The Whipray differs from the other two sorts , having a small , but longer Tail , and ending with a Knob , shaped like a Harpoon . All these three sorts are much about a Foot and half broad . There is yet another sort of these flat Fish of the Whipray kind , but of a prodigious bigness ; viz . three or four Yards square , and their Tails as long : these we call Sea-Devils ; they are very strong Fish , and are sometimes Gamesom ; but they make an odd Figure when they leap out of the Water , tumbling over and over . Neither are Turtle and Manatee wanting in this Lagune . Here are some Hawks-bill-Turtle , but the green Turtle is most plentiful . They are of a middle size ; yet here was once a very large one taken , as I have mentioned in my Voyages round the World . Here are abundance of Manatee , which are both large and sweet . Alligators are also in great numbers in all the Creeks , Rivers and Lagunes in the Bay of Campeachy ; and I think that no part of the Universe is better stock \\' d with them . The Alligator is a Creature so well known every where , that I should not describe it , were it not to give an Account of the difference between it and the Crocodile ; for they resemble each other so nearly in their shape and bulk , as also in their Natures , that they are generally mistaken for the same Species ; only the one supposed to be the Male , the other the Female : Whether they are so or not , the World may judge by the following Observations . As to their Bulk and length , I never saw any so large as some I have heard and read of ; but accor | ding to my best Judgment , though I have seen Thousands , I never met with any above sixteen or seventeen Foot long , and as thick as a large Colt . He his shaped like a Lizard , of a dark brown colour , with a large head and very long Jaws , with great strong Teeth , especially two of a Remarkable Length , that grow out of , and at the very end of the under Jaw in the smallest part , on each side one ; there are two holes in the upper Jaw to receive these , otherways he could not shut his Mouth . It has 4 short Legs and Broad Claws , with a long Tail . The Head , Back and Tail is fenced with pretty hard Scales , joyned together with a very thick tough Skin : Over its Eyes there are two hard scally Knobs , as big as a Mans Fist , and from the Head to the Tail , along the Ridge of his Back \\' tis full of such knotty hard Scales , not like Fish-Scales , which are loose , but so united to the Skin , that it is all one with it , and can \\' t be taken asunder , but with a sharp Knife . From the Ridge of the Back down on the Ribs towards the Belly , ( which is of a dusky yellow colour like a Frog ) there are many of these Scales , but not so substantial nor so thick placed as the other . These Scales are no hindrance to him in turning ; for he will turn very quick , considering his length . When he goes on Land his Tail drags on the Ground . The Flesh smells very strong of Musk ; especially four Kernels or Cods that are always found about them , two of which grow in the Groin , near each Thigh ; the other two at the Breast , one under each Fore-leg , and about the bigness of a Pullets Egg ; therefore when we kill an Alligator , we take out these , and having dried them wear them in our Hats for a perfume . The Flesh is seldom eaten but in case of Necessity , because of it strong scent . Now the Crocodile hath none of these Kernels , neither doth his Flesh taste at all Musky , therefore esteemed better Food . He is of a yellow colour , neither hath he such long Teeth in his under Jaw . The Crocodile \\' s Legs also are longer , and when it runs on Land , it bears its Tail above the Ground , and turns up the tip of it in a round bow , and the Knots on the back are much thicker , higher and firmer than those of the Alligator ; and differ also as to the Places where they are found . For in some Parts , as here in the Bay of Campeachy , are abundance of Alligators , where yet I never saw nor heard of any Crocodiles . At the Isle Grand Caymanes , there are Crocodiles , but no Alligators . At Pines by Cuba , there are abundance of Crocodiles , but I cannot say there are no Alligators , tho \\' I never saw any there . Both Kinds are called Caymanes , by the Spaniards ; therefore probably they may reckon them for the same . And I know of no other difference , for they both lay Eggs alike , which are not distinguishable to the Eye : They are as big as a Goose-Egg , but much longer , and good Meat ; yet the Alligators Eggs taste very musky : They prey both alike in either Element , for they love Flesh as well as Fish , and will live in either fresh or salt Water . Beside these Creatures , I know none that can live any where , or upon any sort of Food , like them . \\' Tis reported , that they love Dogs Flesh better than any other Flesh what | soever . This I have seen with my own Eyes , that our Dogs were so much afraid of them , that they would not very willingly drink at any great River or Creek where those Creatures might lurk and hide themselves , unless they were ( through Necessity ) constrained to it ; and then they would stand five or six Foot from the brink of the Creek or River , and bark a considerable time before they would Adventure nearer ; and then even at the sight of their own Shadows in the Water , they would again retire to the Place from whence they came , and bark vehemently a long time ; so that in the dry Season , when there was no fresh Water but in Ponds and Creeks , we used to fetch it our selves and give it our Dogs ; and many times in our Hunting , when we came to a large Creek that we were to pass through , our Dogs would not follow us ; so that we often took them in our Arms , and carried them over . Besides the fore-mentioned difference between the Alligator and Crocodile ; the latter is accounted more fierce and daring then the Alligator : There | fore when we go to the Isles of Pines or Grand Caymanes to hunt , we are often molested by them , especially in the Night . But in the Bay of Cam | peachy , where there are only Alligators , I did never know any Mischief done by them , except by accident Men run themselves into their Jaws . I remember one Instance of this Nature , which is as follows . In the very height of the dry time seven or eight Men ( English and Irish ) went to a place called Pies Pond , on Beef-Island , to hunt . This Pond was never dry , so that the Cattle drew hither in swarms , but after two or three days hunting they were shy , and would not come to the Pond till Night , and then if an Army of Men had lain to oppose them , they would not have been debarr \\' d of Water . The Hunters knowing their Custom , lay still all Day , and in the Night visited this Pond , and killed as many Beefs as they could . This Trade they had driven a Week , and made great profit . At length an Irish-man going to the Pond in the Night , stumbled over an Alligator that lay in the Path : The Alligator seized him by the Knee ; at which the Man cries out , Help ! help ! His Consorts not know | ing what the matter was , ran all away from their Huts , supposing that he was fallen into the Clutches of some Spaniards , of whom they were afraid every dry Season . But poor Daniel not finding any assistance , waited till the Beast opened his Jaw to take better hold ; because it is usual for the Alligator to do so ; and then snatch \\' d away his Knee , and slipt the But-end of his Gun in the room of it , which the Alligator griped so hard , that he pull \\' d it out of his Hand and so went away . The Man being near a small Tree climb \\' d up out of his reach ; and then cried out to his Consorts to come and assist him ; who being still within Call , and watching to hear the Issue of the Ala | rum , made haste to him with Fire-brands in their Hands , and brought him away in their Arms to his Hut ; for he was in a deplora | ble condition , and not able to stand on his Feet , his Knee was so torn with the Alligators Teeth . FLORIDA WATER . — This perfume , which , of course , is not protected with a proprietary name , is one of exceedingly popular character in America , and , to a smaller extent , in far Eastern countries that import it . It is , in the United States , largely what lavender water is in England . It is a toilet perfume somewhat resembling a mixture of lavender water and eau de Cologne , rounded off with one or more of the following bodies ; cassia oil ( or cinnamon oil , or cinnamic aldehyde ) ; clove oil ( or pimento oil , bay oil , or eugenol ) ; and lemongrass oil . FOIN-COUPE . — This popular type of perfume is supposed to reproduce the odour of new-mown hay . It is invariably based on coumarin , modified by lavender , bergamot , and other perfumes , according to the exact note the perfumer wishes to give to his product . The odour of true new-mown hay is due more to the sweet-scented grass known as Anthoxanthum odoratum than to any other grass , although many others contribute to it . Several different types of clover , of course , also add to the fragrance of the hayfield odour . This odour is probably the result of glucosidal decomposition of constituents present in the plants , resulting in the formation of a little coumarin . He coughed slightly and said , ‘ Yes , ’ and the way he said it told me that it was going to be a romantic occasion . Then dawn . If there is anything more wonderful in London than dawn coming up over the tangled shipping of the docks I would like to know of it . First a silvery light in the air , a chilly greyness , then a flush in the east , and , with startling suddenness , every mast , every funnel , every leaning crane is suhouetted jet-black against the pearl-coloured sky . . . . Unreal . . . still . . . silent . Gradually the docks awaken . Men walk along the wharf-side , doors are opened . In the depths of little ships men rise and become busy with ropes ; there is , from some , a smell of frying bacon ; on tall ships mast lights grow pale in the dawn light , men in swinging cradles yawn and start painting a ship ’ s hull , and from far off comes the ring of the first hammer of a new day . As the light grows , one ’ s sense of smell improves . This is strange . The air is now full of a pungent smell of hemp and tow and tar , and even distant docks , stored with their merchandise , seem to contribute their part as the dawn wind blows . There is a flush of pink cloud high up in the sky , such a delicate flamingo pink that changes , spreads , and fades even as you look . It becomes gold , and you know that at any moment the sun may nise up like a tocsin and call the world to work . We found the ship . A mountain she was , towering up above us with tiny holes in her side like the entrances to caves . She smelt of fried fish , bacon and eggs and coffee . . . . Soon after I was aboard I had to look the other way , for I had seen my friend holding a girl in his arms and I had heard himm Say : ‘ And how are you , darling ? ’ ‘ Splendid ! ’ she cried . ‘ Let me look at you ! At the time of my examination , it had become full , and the liquid portion of its contents fermenting , from the heat of the weather , was overflowing the wooden covering of the cesspool , and running into the neighbouring gardens . The stench was so great , that several of the inmates of the houses applied personally to me to get it abated . The cesspool has been since emptied , and the evil suspended for a time ; proper drainage would be the only really efficient remedy . Sickness and Mortality . Forty-four deaths were registered during the month of May . Nine inquests were held ; two on persons who died suddenly , from disease , one on an elderly woman , 81 , who expired from the effect of accidental burning , and six on persons drowned , by committing suicide or otherwise . The oldest person registered , was a male , aged 91 , two females attained each the age of 82 . The parish continues healthy , andfreerfrom epidemicdisease than it was , perhaps , ever known before . One death from typhoid fever occurred in a child , five years old , but not one took place either from measles , smallpox , scarlet-fever , or hooping-cough . Yours respectfully , Jane , 1857 . W . MURDOCH . EIGHTEENTH RE PORT . Gentlemen , Complaints are being continually made by the inhabitants of Rotlierhithe-street , from the southern extremity of Swan-lane to the \\\\ \" Horns , \\\\ \" of the foul smells which they have been obliged to endure for some time past . Nor are these complaints without foundation ; for in the above mentioned length of Street , about a mile , there are , besides the Surrey Consumer\\'s Gas Works , no less than nine factories for the fabrication of patent manure , that is to say , nine sources of fetid gases . When these factories are in full activity , as they are from the month of December to July , the stores of stinking ingredients used by the manufacturers , 9 give a permanent smell to some parts of the street , and when the mixing goes on , the action of the sulphuric acid upon the animal and vegetable matter gives out a stench , which has occasioned headache , nausea , vomiting and cough to some of the inmates of the houses adjacent to the factories . I have made many visits to these places during the past month , and hvae found no reason to alter the opinion , which I have always hitherto expressed to this Board , in many of my previous reports ; i.e . , that the making of patent manure in open troughs is always a nuisance , and ought not to be allowed in a crowded neighbourhood . The only remedy then for the present state of things , appears to be the following ; either to take legal proceedings against each manufacturer , individually , for the suppression of the nuisance , or to force hiin to conduct his operations in closed vessels , and to carry the gases evolved in mixing , through a fire and up a shaft , that they may be thoroughly decomposed before escaping into the atmosphere . I should mention that some of the patent manure manufacturers make sulphuric acid on the premises . The only case of imperfect drainage mentioned in the Agenda Paper , which requires particular notice , is that of the houses 3 and 4 , Goldsworthy-terrace . These two houses have a cesspool in common . At No . 4 , there is pan and water supply , at No . 3 , a privy without either . Now , it so happens , that the cesspool has no outlet , and fills with the water let off at No . 4 , and No . 3 lying rather lower than No . 4 , the yard of the former is often inundated . The remedy is obvious , to connect the cesspool with the nearest drain . The Dodds-place ditch is in a filthy state ; when cast during the last month , the effluvium arising from it caused great annoyance to the neighbourhood . Much benefit would accrue , were this ditch oftener flushed with water than it has been of late . The Railway arches have again been objects of my attention . On the 30th June about one o\\'clock p.m . , the unpleasant smell of the vapour of linseed oil extended for a considerable distance round the arches occupied by Messrs . Pullinger and Rattenbury . On application for admission to the premises , it was refused to the Inspector and myself . Admission was also refused at the arch 501 . I have every reason to believe that the arch 501 is either a factory for patent manure , or a warehouse for its ingredients . An overpowering stench was perceived in and about the Tunnel-square , on the morning of Wednesday , the 24th June . It seemed to come from the north-east , and was referred by many to the Gas Works . I therefore made it my business to visit those works repeatedly , and to spend some hours on the 10 promises ; I must premise by stating , that no means has yet been discovered of carrying on the process of gas-making without offensive odours . In some respects , great improvements have taken place . Sulphate of iron , mixed with saw-dust , has been substituted as a purifier , instead of milk of lime , which was formerly a source of greatgrievance to the neighbouring dwellinghouses ; when it was emptied from the purifying vessels into an open pit in the yard , emitting , at the time of its discharge , aud afterwards , large quantities of hydrosulphurous gas . I caused a purifier , containing dry lime , and another , containing the sulphate of iron to be stirred up in my presence ; I perceived nothing more than the ordinary smell of gas , and that not so strongly as I expected . 1 mentioned in my first Report , that sulphate of ammonia is fabricated on the premises , and described the process . A new branch of industry has sprung up since that Report was written , namely , the making of the muriate , or rather hydrochlorate of ammonia . This salt is produced by causing the gas , immediately after the first process of washing and still containing much ammonia , to pass through a solution of chloride of manganese , in a closed vessel . Decomposition takes place , hydrochlorate of ammonia is formed , and the oxyde of manganese precipitated . The mother liquor , containing the muriate of ammonia in solution , is then drawn off and allowed to settle . It is afterwards brought up in large shallow troughs , lined with lead and heated by pipes , through which hot steam is continually passing , the muriate of ammonia becoming deposited as the water disappears . The vessel containing the solution of muriate of ammonia was emptied out in my presence . A slight effluvium of sulphurous gases was given off , but it did not last long nor extend itself beyond the building . A fault was originally committed by the Parish of Rotherhithe , in allowing a Gas Company to establish its works so near the dwellings ; but now that these works are established , I think it a part of my duty to visit them occasionally and report thereon to this Vestry . I have the pleasing assertion to make , that in no month since I have addressed reports to this Board , has the mortality been so small as in June , 1857 ; only twenty-four deaths having been registered in Rotherhithe , ten less than in the corresponding month of last year , and thirteen under the usual monthly average . The parish continues quite free from epidemic disease , nor has a single death therefrom been registered during the just elapsed months . A few cases of mild diarrhoea have occurred , but no fatal one has been recorded . 11 Rotherhithe at this moment ( 30th June , 1857 ) , is remarkably healthy . Daring the three months , ending June 30th , two hundred and two children were born , ninety-nine males and one hundred and three females ; and one hundred and four deaths , from all causes , were registered , fifty-nine males and forty-five females , giving a majority of ninety-eight more births than deaths . Yours respectfully , July , 1857 . W . MURDOCH . NINETEENTH REPORT . Gentlemen , Among the various blocks of houses with which the inhabited part of Rotherhithe is covered , it would be difficult to find , on an equal space of ground , a fouler collection of cesspools than those visited by the Inspector and myself in Swan-lane , Norfolkplace , York-street , York-place , and the west side of Clarencestreet , the numbers of the dwellings being given in the Agenda Paper . Almost every cesspool was full , and at Nos . 21 and 22 , York-street , the 3rards were covered with overflowing filth . I tasted the water from the butt at No . 21 ; it was strongly impregnated with the flavour of drainage . Not a proper ashpit was to be seen at any of these places , the dust and refuse being either scattered over the yard , or thrown into a corner . The superficial drainage appeared to have been originally tolerably good , but at many houses it was choked up . There was water supply everywhere , but the receptacles for the water were generally too small , and often unclean ; scarcely a butt had a cover , and the contents were , consequently , exposed to receive all sorts of impurities frbm the atmosphere . I felt during this examination , that notwithstanding all the past exertions of this Board and its Officers , the task of improving the habitations of the poor , of introducing therein order and cleanliness , and of humanizing their habits of life , is still in its infancy ; but , as I have often said before , I consider this humanization of the habits of the people as necessary a part of education as the culture of the understanding . The house , No . 352 , Rotherliithe-wall , is tenanted by a greengrocer ; it was formerly a warehouse or factory . In the upper and front part of the warehouse , sleeping-rooms have been built ; the back part remains much the same as it was originally , and is used as a stable . The from part of the basement floor , under the sleeping-rooms , is a shop with a small , dark room partitioned off , so that the stable and the dwelling-house 12 are under one roof . Two horses are kept in the stable , in a corner of which the dung is thrown , and with it all the refuse matter from the greenshop . During the hot weather , this heap exhaled a smell most offensive to the inmates of the neighbouring houses . I entered one of them ; the stench in the sitting room was worse than that of a privy . I suggested that the dungheap be immediately removed , and the place washed with chloride of lime , which was done . I must leave to the Vestry , to deal with this matter as they think fit ; but , if the stable be allowed at all , the dung ought to be carted away , and the place purified daily with chloride of lime or zinc . I feel it my duty to make one remark before leaving the subject . I asked the occupier about the health of his family ; he told me at once that only those children that came to the place with him were still alive . Every child born in this locality ( three in number ) had died in early infancy ; for the very simple reason that adults and large children could escape occasionally from such an atmosphere , while the poor infants , from the moment of their birth , inhaled the fatal exhalations of decomposing animal and vegetable matter . The mortality of young children may always be considered as one of the best indexes of the sanitary condition of any population . At the request of the Vestry Clerk , 1 examined , on the 25th of July , the three tenements — Nos . 15 , 10 , and 17 , Rotherhithe New-road , near the Railway arches . A large cesspool has been dug in the garden of the middle house , ( No . 16 ) , to receive the drainage of all three , and covered with boards and earth . Having become full and the contents fermenting , from the heat of the sun , the garden of No . 16 was covered with sewage , and offered to the eye a frightful mass of putrescence . The inhalation of the pestilential vapours arising from such a nuisance had , at the time of my visit , already begun its work . Three children at No . 16 had been affected with severe diarrhoea . A notice was immediately served . The stench from two street gullies in Clarence-street , has been much complained of , I beg to submit the propriety of trapping them , to the favourable consideration of the Board . The putrid smell of the Thames water has been noted in several of the public papers , and among others , in the weekly reports of the Registrar-general , and has undoubtedly , been remarked by many of the gentlemen here present . 1 must again mention that the large population of Hanover-street , have no water supply except from a tidal rcell , and unless they content themselves with stinking Thames water , must beg or steal all they.consume . On the \\' 27th July , I examined some of the water 13 from the well , it smelt as if it had been recently dipped from a sewer . The whole water supply of Western Rotherhithe has , during the past month , been often scanty and deficient . The high cisterns frequently receiving no water for several days together . It appears to me that more pressure is required at the central works , that the mains in this Parish are generally rather too small , and that much water is wasted by the carelessness of the inhabitants themselves . Let me add , however , in justice to the Southwark and Vauxhall Company , that their water is of good quality . In the eastern or lower district which receives its mains from the Kent Water Works , the water is also of good quality , and no complaints are ever heard about the supply being defective . Under the Railway arches , the nuisances seem somewhat abated . The only stench perceived by me on the 27th July , was a strong odour of sugar scum issuing from some of the arches . Complaints have been often made of the smell of the mud of the mill-stream between Mill-pond Bridge and the Surrey Mills . Into this portion of the stream is discharged the drainage of about thirty-three bouses ; namely , of all the east side of West Lane , of West-place , of Iphigenia Cottages , of three houses in Paradise-street , and of all the west side of Gillam\\'s-court , except one house . The mud is , in consequence , a mass of fermenting sewage , The house , No . 26 , Gillam\\'s-court , is the only one properly drained , the closet has a pan and water supply , and appended to it an excellent ashpit . It might be taken as a model of the manner in which small dwellings should be fitted up with regard to these matters . The prevalent disease during July was , and still continues to be , diarrhcea , the Parish being perfectly free from all other epidemics . Nine persons have succumbed to that complaint , one being registered as dying from choleraic diarrhoea , and one from cholera infantum , so that above one-fourth of the whole mortality of the month has been occasioned by diarrhcea ; the number of deaths registered being thirty-five , still under the average monthly death rate , and ten less than in the corresponding month of the year 1856 . The month of July having in that year been in Rotherhithe one of the most unhealthy . Yours respectfully , August , 1857 . W . MURDOCH . 14 TWENTIETH REPORT . Gentlemen , If a person who had been absent from Rotherliithe for the last few years was at present to visit it , he could not fail to be struck with the improvements which have taken place in its general aspect by the filling up of some of the many ditches and open sewers which formerly intersected it in every direction . There is no doubt that to this and other measures of sanitary reform are mainly attributable , the amended health of the place , the almost entire absence of fever , and the diminished severity of epidemic disease , a statement which is proved by the concurrent testimony of the medical practitioners , and by the weekly returns of the Registrar-general . Rotherliithe , however , still contains three of the foulest ditches in the whole neighbourhood of London — namely , the Earle Sewer , the Surrey Mills , and the King\\'s Mills tidal streams . Of the two former , I have spoken in my previous reports ; my business on this occasion is with the King\\'s Mills stream only . This watercourse , as marked on the maps , is about three miles in length , but as some of its numerous windings have been filled up or become dry , a mile and a half may be about its present extent . It has not been cleansed for these ten years , and the mud in all parts of it is several feet in thickness . The tide not being now let in from the river either so often or so abundantly as formerly , the water in the remote ramifications of the stream scarcely covers the mud , is hardly ever properly renewed , stagnates , and putrifies . The worst portion , however , is from the outlet into the Thames to the first divisiou into two main branches , a distance of about six hundred feet . The western embankment at this spot , is formed by the premises of the Surrey Consumers \\' Gas Company , and their refuse water and tar find their way into the bed of the watercourse . The family of Mr . Latreille , whose house is situated near the outlet into the Thames , have much suffered in health from the stenches generated when the pond is emptied . I consider the King\\'s Mills Stream a nuisance of the worst kind , and as many complaints have been made to me about it , I thought it advisable to bring it at once under the notice of this Vestry . In Wellington-street , Albion-street , there is , after rain , a pool of stagnant water , from which , during the hot weather , a disagreeable stench arises . No . 23 , Queen-street is an overcrowded house , its six rooms . being occupied by five families , in all twenty-two people . For all these there was a small water-butt , holding about fifty gallons ; and every other thing conducing to comfort or convenience , cleanliness or health , shamefully deficient . 15 The numerous houses mentioned in the Agenda Paper have been visited by the Inspector and myself , and notices served . Two of them , however , deserve special remark , namely , Nos . 4 and 5 , Queen-street . The drainage of these two dwellings runs from the back to the front , through an open wooden trough under the floor of the lower rooms , and discharges itself by a sort of pigeon-hole in the wall into the street ; the neighbours and passengers complain of the stench generated by the drainage stagnating on the pavement and in the gutter . I beg earnestly again to direct the attention of the Inspecting Committee of the Western District to a row of eight tworoomed tenements , called Adam\\'s-place . These tenements are quite unventilated , there being no openings in any of them , except a window and a door on the groundfloor and a window on the first floor , all in front of each house . Before each house is a yard , about twelve or thirteen feet long and ten broad ; and at its extremity , furthest removed from the dwelling , a privy . As almost every yard is inundated from the overflowing of the cesspool , and in one or two cases , the filth is literally penetrating into the ground floor of the houses , every breath inhaled by the inmates must be charged with the effluvia arising from the liquid pollution . The houses have no water supply whatever . This row is a disgrace to the owners whoever they may be ; for , notwithstanding many warnings , they have heartlessly left a mass of putrefaction to bake for months in the sun of this tropical summer , at the risk of the health of the inhabitants , who are composed of the poorest class ; and who , in their utter helplessness to better , by any effort of their own , the condition of their dwellings , are continually making appeals to your officers . At the back of the houses , 380 , 381 , and 382 , Rotherhithewall , there is a piece of ground measuring fifty feet north and south , by about thirty-nine east and west , with a large shed at its southern extremity . In the middle has been erected a temporary tent or awning . This ground is occupied by a sack and bag merchant . The bags repaired there have generally contained rapeseed , linseed , rice , or other grain . Great complaints have been made of this place , and consequently I have frequently visited it . The rape and linseed fall from the bags on to the ground , which is unpaved , lie there and rot ; and after a shower of rain , the stench is most offensive . I borrowed a small scoop from a neighbouring grocer , and with it took up a quantity of the earth ; there were almost as many maggots as there were seeds ; it was a mass of living and crawling putrefaction . Nor is this all ; clouds of dust issue from the bags , to the great annoyance of the neighbouring 16 tradesmen , filling their dwellings and injuring their goods . From seventy to one hundred females , women and girls , principally Irish , are employed in this locality , and may be seen , at any hour of the day , squatting about the yard and mending the bags . The obscene language and dirty habits of these women are a source of disgust to the whole neighbourhood . There is no convenience to the yard and , at the time of revisits in the early part of . the month , the ladies were in the habit of using for such a purpose a piece of ground , exposed to view on every side , about fifteen feet square , and situated to the south of the yard above described . On this spot , public decency was violated fifty times a day ; and the secondary nuisance arising therefrom was as bad or worse than the original one . It seems ludicrous to serve a notice for a stopped drain or full cesspool , if such a human piggery as the one above delineated is to be tolerated in one of the most populous parts of the parish . I have confined my observations to the nuisance , and have not touched upon the demoralizing effect that such indelicacies must produce , among the younger branches of those who work on the establishment . The number of deaths registered during last month , was thirty-nine , rather above the average monthly mortality , but still ten under the corresponding month of last year . Nine deaths have occurred from diarrhoea , the parish being entirely free from all other epidemic disease . The number of cases of diarrhoea have , however , considerably diminished during the last week . Yours respectfully , September , 1857 . W . MURDOCH . TWENTY-FIRST REPORT . Gentlemen , As the time for licensing slaughter-houses is now approaching , at the request of the Vestry-clerk ( Mr . Hawks ) , I have carefully examined all the places used in Rotherhithe for the slaughter of cattle . Twelve licences were granted last year , and eleven of the persons who obtained them are again applicants . One slaughterhouse of the number , namely , that in Elephant-lane , attached to the premises formerly occupied by Mr . Onion , being shut up . They are generally in good order , and what few deficiencies existed in some have been , or are being , corrected , under my 17 supervision ; and , with due submission to this Board , I can see no objection to a renewal of the licenses . Two other butchers , besides the eleven above-mentioned , have made application for licenses , viz . , Mr . Adams , of Lower Yorkstreet , and Mr . Austin , of Rotherhithe-wall ; the slaughterhouse of the former being at the back of his dwelling , that of the latter in Seven-step-alley . Both these places are clean , stone-paved , with good water supply , ventilation , and apparatus , and the neighbourhood round them is not overcrowded . I beg , therefore , to recommend them to the favour of the Vestry . There are no underground slaughter-houses in Rotherhithe . The numerous houses , mentioned in the Agenda Paper , either have full cesspools connected with them , or their drainage is imperfect . The following , however , deserve particular mention . At No . 8 , \\' Swan-lane , there is no privy accommodation whatever ; the inmates of the house are obliged to use the closet of a neighbour . At the White Cottage in Adam\\'s-gardens , the privy is in a miserably filthy and dilapidated state ; and , as there is no drain on the premises , all the slops are thrown into the open road . At Nos . 1 , 2 , and 3 , Ivy-place , the cesspools are full , and the people complain of the scantiness of the water supply , a complaint which I am often obliged to hear in various parts of upper Rotherhithe . The Southwark and Vauxhall Company will , undoubtedly , have to make extensive alterations to meet the growing wants of an increasing population . The water-closets of each of the tenements 4 and 5 , Paradiseplace , is a sort of cupboard , situated at the top of the house . A cistern is supposed to supply each closet , but as the cistern itself only receives the rain which runs from the roof , the water supply is desultory and irregular . The pipe also conveying the solid and liquid matter down to a drain under the flooring of the houses is leaky , and the lower part of the houses , more especially of No . 4 , is often covered with liquid sewage , and smells abominably . The remedy for such a state of things would be either to put a trap and pan to the present closets and carry to the cisterns a proper and regular supply of water , or better still , to build new water-closets on some part of the premises . At the back of the yards of the houses , from 4 to 11 , Westlane , there is an alley or passage between the yards and the neighbouring mill-stream . This alley is a receptacle for all sorts of offal , and is often in a most digusting state . The Inspector and myself have often visited the spot , and always found it in the same condition . The houses from 4 to 11 , West-lane , c 18 being tenanted by a very poor and improvident class of persons , I would suggest that some steps be taken to keep the passage clear and free from nuisance . The houses on the east side of Berkeley-street have no drainage , all the refuse water , slops , soapsuds , & c . , being thrown or run into a small ditch at the back of the yards , and located on the land of a market gardener . In the course of time the ditch has become full of stagnant sewage , and the stenches arising therefrom during the summer caused annoyance to the dwellers in Berkeley-street and Chester-terrace . The houses ought to be drained into the neigbouring sewer , and I am credibly informed , that on service of a notice , steps were immediately taken by the landlord to that effect . The sack merchant , spoken of in my last Report , on receiving a notice from this Vestry , struck his tent , and evacuated with all his troop , sacks , bags , and baggage the position which he had so long occupied on Rotherhithe-wall , to the great discomfort of his neighbours . Forty deaths were registered in this parish during the month of September , eight of these were from diarrhoea and dysentery ; of the eight , six were children , one an adult , and the other an elderly female aged 83 . Two cases of typhoid fever have proved fatal ; one of these , a single person aged 18 , imported it with her from Havre-de-Grace ( France ) , where she had been in service . In the other case , a married woman of 24 , the malady seems to have been generated in this locality . She resided in Swan-lane , about fifty feet from that part of the King\\'s-mills \\' stream , which was described in my last Report , as one of the greatest nuisances in Rotherhithe , or any other part of the metropolis . The other epidemics , namely , measles , scarlatina , hoopingcough , and small-pox , have been absent from the neighbourhood during the whole of the summer , no death from any of them having been recorded since April last . I consider that at this present time ( 1st October , 1857 ) , the number of cases of illness in Rotherhithe is under the average , and at the same time , I must state , that since April it has been freer from the four epidemics above-named , than I have ever before known it . Long may it continue so . During the quarter ending October 1st , 1857 , one hundred and fourteen persons died , fifty-nine males , and fity-five females ; and there were born one hundred and ninety-three children , ninety-eight males and ninety-five females , the excess of births over deaths , being seventy-nine . Yours respectfully , October , 1857 . W . MURDOCH . 19 TWENTY-SECOND REPORT . Gentlemen , Your Officers have always considered it their first and most important duty , to penetrate into the dwellings of the humbler classes , and to introduce therein , as much as possible , cleanliness and order , without , which all attempts at social improvement must necessarily fail . Hanover-street , inhabited by the poorest people in Rotherhithe , has often been to them an object of solicitude . This street , sloping southwards down from the bank of the river consists with its appendage , Hanover-court , of about thirty-eight houses , two of which at the north end , are of modern construction , the remaining thirty-six are exceedingly old and inconveniently built . As a correspondence relative to the state of this property has recently taken place between the Vestry Clerk and the freeholder , the Inspector and myself were induced to examine it , not cursorily and superficially , but by a visitation from house to house , noting down the merits and demerits of the place , and the result of our obervations I have condensed in the following report . The houses , though old and out of repair , are tenantable , and with few exceptions , wind and water-tight , and not in worse condition than dwellings in other parts of the metropolis occupied by a similar class of population . The main-drainage of the street is excellent , a new sewer having lately been constructed by order of this Vestry . The drainage of the houses has also been , in every case , connected with the sewer , some few of the drains are untrapped , but the greater part of them have siphon-traps of glazed pottery with a coverlid of wood , a mode of trapping which appears fragile and imperfect . The privies are of wood , all in a dilapidated condition and without fastenings . A wooden button on the outside , and a piece of string on the inside of the doors , may be seen here and there . The leaseholder declares that he cannot employ metal as it speedily disappears from the premises . The privies are all fitted with pans and communicate with the sewer , but have no proper water supply ; indeed there is not a cistern or water-butt in the whole street . Heaps of ashes are strewn about the yards , which are in a filthy state , the heap in the yard being the receptacle for all the refuse of the house . Much complaint is made of the neglect of the scavengers , who , according to the statement of the leaseholder , have not regularly and properly removed the dust , and have not put a broom on the surface of the street since February last . The cleansing has been entirely done by himself and the tenants . 20 The water supply of Hanover-street is good , the water having been carried into every yard in Hanover-street , and in Hanover-court where the tenements have no yards , the tap is placed under the window of the ground-floor . As in the latter case , there is no suitable receiving vessel ; I am afraid that in time , the houses will become damp and unwholesome . All the receptacles for water are of the most miserable kind imaginable , pails , washing-tubs , earthenware pans , and butter-firkins supplying the place of butts and cisterns . Hanover-street has certainly improved under the management of the present proprietor , and the inhabitants get now , wholesome water to use and drink , which alone compensates for and palliates many evils . Even a short time ago , they had no water , but from a tidal pump , and the liquid after standing a few hours , smelt as I said in one of my former reports — as if it had been dipped from a sewer . To resume , in a few words , the main points are good , the defects are in the details . At the back of the dwellings , on both sides of the street , there is a large open space , which allows free circulation of air , and accounts to a certain extent , for the statements I am about to make . This street has been during the last two years , the healthiest in Rotherhithe , and it would be difficult to find a more healthful place in the whole metropolis . Medical orders are rarely given by the relieving Officer for the inhabitants ; and in the year 1854 , only one person died there of cholera ; but , let numbers speak . The population of Hanover-street , taken in September , 1853 , was seventy-nine males , ninety-three females , and one hundred and seventy-five children of both sexes , in all , three hundred and forty-seven . On the 30th October , of the present year , it amounted to sixty-four males , seventy-four females , and one hundred and forty-one children , in all , two hundred and seventy-nine ; so that we may safely take the average population at about three hundred . During the last two years , only two have died , both children ; giving a mortality of one per annum , or less than four in the thousand . Now , the average mortality in the metropolis , is about twenty-three in the thousand ; in the healthiest country districts , about twelve ; and in all England , nineteen . Hanover-street , then , deservedly merits the name given to it — the \\\\ \" Vale of Health . \\\\ \" The place is swarming with children , about half of whom were barefooted , and many , no doubt , on short allowance , yet they looked comely , healthy , and hardy , and might be taken as good specimens of the water-side population . At 28 , Princes Street , besides a full cesspool , and a choked drain , there is in the washhouse , a pool of stagnant sewage . 21 All the inmates of the place , complain of sickness and headache \\' and a woman employed to wash clothes on the premises , was \\' from the effect of the stench , suddenly seized with vomiting and purging , and forced to leave her work . She was in perfect health on entering the locality . Two children died in this house during the summer from diarrhcea . This nuisance requires immediate remedy . No . 2 , Albert-place , Nos . 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , and 15 , Bedford-place , and No . 15 , Lower Neptune-street , are cases of imperfect drainage , and full cesspools . Although the mortality of the last month be considerably under the average , thirty-one deaths only having been registered , the Parish of Rotherhithe is hardly so healthy as it was in September . One death from hooping-cough and three from fever being recorded . Measles too , have re-appeared ; a woman of Hanover-street , brought the disease with her from Kent , where she had been hopping ; and from Hanoverstreet it has spread into the neighbouring districts of Swan-lane and Clarence-street . No fatal case has yet occurred . No death has been registered from scarlatina , smallpox , or diarrhoea . A lad , aged 18 , died a few days ago from cholera in twelve hours , on board the Swedish Ship , \\\\ \" Sophia , \\\\ \" lying in the Commercial Docks . She came from Gottenberg . The cholera has always been brought into Great Britain from the Baltic Ports , and seamen on shipboard in vessels from these Ports lying in the Thames or Docks , have mostly , hitherto , been among the first attacked . Of the remote cause of cholera we know nothing , nor has science as yet unravelled the essential nature of ii , or the reason why it always travels in one direction from east to west . But of the means of preventing cholera , much is known . There are certain circumstances favourable to its development , receptive influences , as they have been justly called , and where these are wanting , the disease either does not appear at all , or exercises more mildly its baneful influence . These may be called proximate causes , and are quite under human control ; they relate either to the locality or to the individual . In regard to locality , bad drainage , and bad water , are universally acknowledged to be the circumstances most propitious to the birth and propagation of cholera . In Rotherhithe , the drainage is better , and the water supply of purer quality than they have ever hitherto been , therefore , we are better prepared to receive the pestilence than heretofore . It were useless to repeat my previous reports by exhibiting to you how much these receptive influences gave , in this Parish , quite different characters to the epidemics of 1849 and of 1854 . With regard to the individual , I can only say that the best 22 preventatives of cholera are a cheerful mind and a temperate life ; and , were I to write a book , I could not say more . Fear , by depressing the powers of the mind and body , favours the reception of the disease . Systematic rules of diet have been laid down . I cannot approve of them ; surely that diet is the best which keeps a man in a healthy state , and which enables him to pass comfortably through the daily wear and tear of life , and must , necessarily , be as variable as the constitution of every individual ; and every one who observes himself , must certainly know what that diet , is or should be . All sudden changes of food in time of cholera , are imprudent and dangerous . But there is a class of men particularly liable to the malady , and to whom I would give a word of advice ( for this report will go before the public ) , I mean the habitual drinkers of ardent spirits . In the experience of three epidemics which I have witnessed , one in France , and two in England ; I have invariably found that they are the first , yes , the very first victims of cholera . Indeed , it stands to reason that it should be so . Whatever cholera may be , its first symptoms show themselves in the abdominal viscera , and what is the state of these viscera in the confirmed spirit-drinker ? His stomach is perpetually congested , his appetite gone ; his liver , like the worm of a whiskey-still , has alcohol always passing through it , and is generally functionally , and often organically diseased , and makes him a ready recipient for the complaint . Every dram of raw spirit is , in time of epidemic , a predisposing cause of cholera , and let those of our industrious classes who are fond of morning potations , take timely advice — There is death in the cup . Yours respectfully , November , 1857 . W . MURDOCH . TWENTY-THIRD REPORT . Gentlemen , Variocs complaints having been made to me , by inhabitants of the part of Rotherhithe called Jamaica Level , and by owners of property in that district , of an intolerable nuisance occasioned by the casting of the mud of the mill-stream near the houses . I proceeded thither on the 12th November , and on several other occasions , and can state the following facts ; namely , that the mud of the main channel , from its southern extremity , opposite Cork\\'sgardeh to a spot near Moreton-cottages , had been recently cast up . Part of it had been thrown against the western bank , where there is a public footway , but not on the footway , and only in sufficient quantity to mend the gaps that time had made on the 23 edge of the bank , near the stream . On the eastern embankment , the mud had been piled up in heaps , in different places ; indeed the greater part of what had been removed from the bed of the water-course had been thrown there . In Glebe-terrace , and thereabouts , it had been projected within a few feet of the dwellings ; and in Moreton - terrace , so close to the walls and doors of the houses , that the pathway before them was literally covered with it , , and the inmates forced to walk in and over the mud to get to and from their houses . Although the weather was cold at the time of my examinations , this accumulation of solid sewage , the settlings of a quarter of a century or more , exhaled a faint , sickening smell . No nuisance is more likely to generate disease than such a mass of decomposing organic filth . Ague and typhoid fever are likely to be engendered from such a cause , there being no fact in the whole range of medical science more clearly established , and more universally admitted , than that the effluvium . from , the mud of ponds and ditches is a subtile poison , always injurious , and often fatal , to the human constitution . At the back of Clare-hall-cottages , there is a large dustbin , which stands away from the tenements , and receives the ashes and refuse of several of them . The inmates complain that the scavengers do not remove the dust sufficiently often . I think that the contents of the dustbin ought to be carted away regularly once a week ; and I have , through Mr . Sanders , the inspector , called thereto the attention of the contractor . At No . 12 , Neptune-street , a house let out in lodgings and containing seventeen inmates ; there is no privy and no drainage . I shall not attempt to describe the abominations of the back premises , in consequence of these defects ; the case appears urgent , and wanting immediate remedy . This house has been for a long time in a deplorable condition , and has been frequently visited and reported on before . At Nos . 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , and 6 , Gardiner-row , and 15 , 16 , 17 , Debenham-row , Rotherhithe New-road ; cesspools have been dug in the gardens , to receive the drainage of the houses . The quantity of liquid thrown down and the storm-waters soon fill the cesspools , which overflow , and convert the yards into lakes and ponds of sewage . There being no sewer in the neighbourhood , the only remedy for such a state appears to be , a frequent cleansing of the cesspools , unless the landlords be allowed to drain into a neighbouring open ditch . However undesirable draining into open ditches may be , in the abovementioned case , it would be infinitely preferable to what at present exists , by carrying the sewage further away from the dwellings , and into an open space , where the effluvia becoming diluted would , in all probability , be harmless . 24 An open ditch , beginning by a dead head at the southern extremity of Berkeley-street , after running a course of about two hundred and fifty or three hundred yards , discharges itself into the sewer in Swan-lane . The ditch itself is clean and without smell , and receives the drainage of ten small houses . It is a nuisance certainly , as all open ditches are ; but a very small one , compared to the King\\'s-mills stream , which is within a few yards of it , and on whose nearly stagnant water , green slime , mud , and putrefying vegetable matter , I have often commented in my former reports . Forty-three deaths were registered in Rotherhithe during November ; the monthly mortality having been increased by six inquests . The beginning of winter has had its usual effects upon the aged , the death of no less than ten persons above the age of 70 having been recorded ; namely , six between the ages of 70 and 80 ; three , between eighty and ninety ; and one of a nonagenarian , the widow of a mariner , residing in Paradisestreet . The epidemics prevalent are hooping-cough and measles ; four deaths have been caused by the former , and one by the latter . Yours respectfully , December , 1857 . W . MURDOCH . TWENTY-FOURTH REPORT . Gentlemen , The manufacture of patent manure in open vessels , is always a nuisance , but varying in degree according to the materials employed . The worst kinds of effluvia are generated by the action of sulpuric acid upon raw bones , blood , pieces of skin , soot , sugarscum , and such-like ingredients . A strong acid smell also always pervades the atmosphere in the neighbourhood of the factories , while the mixing is going on . The sulphuric acid itself , being but slightly volatile , I suspect that particles of it are carried up by the numerous gases evolved in the process . These gases are injurious to the health ; many persons have complained of nausea and headache , from their effects ; the acid fumes , too , are highly irritating to individuals with the least tendency to cough , or to any bronchial affection . The manufacture of patent manure has , however , of late , become an important branch of industry in Rotherhithe , and gives employment to a considerable number of the poorest class of the labouring population . It never has been the intention of any person connected with this vestry , either to 25 annoy the manufacturers or injure the labouring classes ; but , at the same time , it is the duty of the officers to listen to all reasonable complaints of the inhabitants . Now , the comfort of the inhabitants , and the toleration of patent manure factories may be perfectly reconciled , by conducting the process of manufacture in closed vessels , instead of open troughs . The possibility of so doing was hinted at by me in one of my previous reports . The idea was , at the time , treated with derision by some gentlemen engaged in the trade , as being quite impracticable . That it is , however , practical and practised , may be witnessed by any one who chooses to visit the factory of Messrs . Brown and Co . at Globe-stairs . A stout cyclindrical vessel , in shape resembling a tar-barrel has been constructed under the superintendence of the manager . On one side of it is a flap or door which can be hermetically closed and bolted ; this cylinder is destined to revolve , and one of the spindles on which it turns is hollow , and communicates with a tube . The tube disharges itself into the shaft , to the top of which is eighty feet above the level of the earth . The vessel holds five hundred weight , is easily charged , and discharged by opening the flap , and when charged is made to revolve by steam-power , eighteen or twenty times . By these revolutions the stuif is thoroughly mixed and the manure perfected . The gases given off during the operation escape through the spindle and tube into the shaft , and disperse themselves high up in the atmosphere . The compound is better mixed than when done in the usual way , time , labour and money are also saved . In consequence of a letter addressed to me in the beginning of the month , complaining of the stenches emanating from the premises of Messrs . Ashton and Proctor , near Lavender Dock , I visited them . The men were making manure in open vessels , and the smell in the street was so offensive , that remarks thereon were uttered by almost every passenger . A few days after my visit the nuisance was discontinued . To conclude , 1 am of opinion that patent manure may be made in properly closed vessels without nuisance , and that all manufacturers of that article , whose premises are offensive to the neighbouring inhabitants , should be compelled to erect proper machinery for conducting the operation of mixing in such a manner that the fetid gases exhaled therefrom be carried into a high shaft , and if they are still found to be a nuisance , that they be burned by passing through a coke fire before escaping into the air . A statement was made at the last meeting of this Board , that foul smells , injurious to the health of the neighbours , were given out from the premises 47 and 48 , Lower Queen-street , and that 26 after rain , there existsd in the back yards , pools of stagnant water . I visited this place six times in rainy and dry weather . The drains are untrapped , and there is a pan , but no water supply to the the closet . The yards in other respects are clean and orderly , I never could perceive any foul smell , or did I observe any pool of stagnant water , and in this statement I am borne out by the testimony of the Surveyor and other Officers of this Vestry . At the Bell public-house in Church-street , the water finds its way occasionally into the cellar . For , while he was but too ready to accept the position that was almost immediately offered to him on his coming of age , and found , indeed , a subtle pleasure in the thought that he might really become to the London of his own day what to imperial Neronian Rome the author of the Satyricon once had been , yet in his inmost heart he desired to be something more than a mere arbiter elegantiarum , to be consulted on the wearing of a jewel , or the knotting of a necktie , or the conduct of a cane . He sought to elaborate some new scheme of life that would have its reasoned philosophy and its ordered principles , and find in the spiritualizing of the senses its highest realization . The worship of the senses has often , and with much justice , been decried , men feeling a natural instinct of terror about passions and sensations that seem stronger than themselves , and that they are conscious of sharing with the less highly organized forms of existence . But it appeared to Dorian Gray that the true nature of the senses had never been understood , and that they had remained savage and animal merely because the world had sought to starve them into submission or to kill them by pain , instead of aiming at making them elements of a new spirituality , of which a fine instinct for beauty was to be the dominant characteristic . As he looked back upon man moving through history , he was haunted by a feeling of loss . So much had been surrendered ! and to such little purpose ! There had been mad wilful rejections , monstrous forms of self-torture and self-denial , whose origin was fear and whose result was a degradation infinitely more terrible than that fancied degradation from which , in their ignorance , they had sought to escape ; Nature , in her wonderful irony , driving out the anchorite to feed with the wild animals of the desert and giving to the hermit the beasts of the field as his companions . Yes : there was to be , as Lord Henry had prophesied , a new Hedonism that was to recreate life and to save it from that harsh uncomely puritanism that is having , in our own day , its curious revival . It was to have its service of the intellect , certainly , yet it was never to accept any theory or system that would involve the sacrifice of any mode of passionate experience . Its aim , indeed , was to be experience itself , and not the fruits of experience , sweet or bitter as they might be . Of the asceticism that deadens the senses , as of the vulgar profligacy that dulls them , it was to know nothing . But it was to teach man to concentrate himself upon the moments of a life that is itself but a moment . There are few of us who have not sometimes wakened before dawn , either after one of those dreamless nights that make us almost enamoured of death , or one of those nights of horror and misshapen joy , when through the chambers of the brain sweep phantoms more terrible than reality itself , and instinct with that vivid life that lurks in all grotesques , and that lends to Gothic art its enduring vitality , this art being , one might fancy , especially the art of those whose minds have been troubled with the malady of reverie . Gradually white fingers creep through the curtains , and they appear to tremble . In black fantastic shapes , dumb shadows crawl into the corners of the room and crouch there . Outside , there is the stirring of birds among the leaves , or the sound of men going forth to their work , or the sigh and sob of the wind coming down from the hills and wandering round the silent house , as though it feared to wake the sleepers and yet must needs call forth sleep from her purple cave . Veil after veil of thin dusky gauze is lifted , and by degrees the forms and colours of things are restored to them , and we watch the dawn remaking the world in its antique pattern . The wan mirrors get back their mimic life . The flameless tapers stand where we had left them , and beside them lies the half-cut book that we had been studying , or the wired flower that we had worn at the ball , or the letter that we had been afraid to read , or that we had read too often . Nothing seems to us changed . Out of the unreal shadows of the night comes back the real life that we had known . We have to resume it where we had left off , and there steals over us a terrible sense of the necessity for the continuance of energy in the same wearisome round of stereotyped habits , or a wild longing , it may be , that our eyelids might open some morning upon a world that had been refashioned anew in the darkness for our pleasure , a world in which things would have fresh shapes and colours , and be changed , or have other secrets , a world in which the past would have little or no place , or survive , at any rate , in no conscious form of obligation or regret , the remembrance even of joy having its bitterness and the memories of pleasure their pain . It was the creation of such worlds as these that seemed to Dorian Gray to be the true object , or amongst the true objects , of life ; and in his search for sensations that would be at once new and delightful , and possess that element of strangeness that is so essential to romance , he would often adopt certain modes of thought that he knew to be really alien to his nature , abandon himself to their subtle influences , and then , having , as it were , caught their colour and satisfied his intellectual curiosity , leave them with that curious indifference that is not incompatible with a real ardour of temperament , and that , indeed , according to certain modern psychologists , is often a condition of it . It was rumoured of him once that he was about to join the Roman Catholic communion , and certainly the Roman ritual had always a great attraction for him . The daily sacrifice , more awful really than all the sacrifices of the antique world , stirred him as much by its superb rejection of the evidence of the senses as by the primitive simplicity of its elements and the eternal pathos of the human tragedy that it sought to symbolize . He loved to kneel down on the cold marble pavement and watch the priest , in his stiff flowered dalmatic , slowly and with white hands moving aside the veil of the tabernacle , or raising aloft the jewelled , lantern-shaped monstrance with that pallid wafer that at times , one would fain think , is indeed the “ panis cælestis , ” the bread of angels , or , robed in the garments of the Passion of Christ , breaking the Host into the chalice and smiting his breast for his sins . The fuming censers that the grave boys , in their lace and scarlet , tossed into the air like great gilt flowers had their subtle fascination for him . As he passed out , he used to look with wonder at the black confessionals and long to sit in the dim shadow of one of them and listen to men and women whispering through the worn grating the true story of their lives . But he never fell into the error of arresting his intellectual development by any formal acceptance of creed or system , or of mistaking , for a house in which to live , an inn that is but suitable for the sojourn of a night , or for a few hours of a night in which there are no stars and the moon is in travail . Mysticism , with its marvellous power of making common things strange to us , and the subtle antinomianism that always seems to accompany it , moved him for a season ; and for a season he inclined to the materialistic doctrines of the Darwinismus movement in Germany , and found a curious pleasure in tracing the thoughts and passions of men to some pearly cell in the brain , or some white nerve in the body , delighting in the conception of the absolute dependence of the spirit on certain physical conditions , morbid or healthy , normal or diseased . Yet , as has been said of him before , no theory of life seemed to him to be of any importance compared with life itself . He felt keenly conscious of how barren all intellectual speculation is when separated from action and experiment . He knew that the senses , no less than the soul , have their spiritual mysteries to reveal . And so he would now study perfumes and the secrets of their manufacture , distilling heavily scented oils and burning odorous gums from the East . He saw that there was no mood of the mind that had not its counterpart in the sensuous life , and set himself to discover their true relations , wondering what there was in frankincense that made one mystical , and in ambergris that stirred one ’ s passions , and in violets that woke the memory of dead romances , and in musk that troubled the brain , and in champak that stained the imagination ; and seeking often to elaborate a real psychology of perfumes , and to estimate the several influences of sweet-smelling roots and scented , pollen-laden flowers ; of aromatic balms and of dark and fragrant woods ; of spikenard , that sickens ; of hovenia , that makes men mad ; and of aloes , that are said to be able to expel melancholy from the soul . At another time he devoted himself entirely to music , and in a long latticed room , with a vermilion-and-gold ceiling and walls of olive-green lacquer , he used to give curious concerts in which mad gipsies tore wild music from little zithers , or grave , yellow-shawled Tunisians plucked at the strained strings of monstrous lutes , while grinning Negroes beat monotonously upon copper drums and , crouching upon scarlet mats , slim turbaned Indians blew through long pipes of reed or brass and charmed—or feigned to charm—great hooded snakes and horrible horned adders . The harsh intervals and shrill discords of barbaric music stirred him at times when Schubert ’ s grace , and Chopin ’ s beautiful sorrows , and the mighty harmonies of Beethoven himself , fell unheeded on his ear . He collected together from all parts of the world the strangest instruments that could be found , either in the tombs of dead nations or among the few savage tribes that have survived contact with Western civilizations , and loved to touch and try them . He had the mysterious juruparis of the Rio Negro Indians , that women are not allowed to look at and that even youths may not see till they have been subjected to fasting and scourging , and the earthen jars of the Peruvians that have the shrill cries of birds , and flutes of human bones such as Alfonso de Ovalle heard in Chile , and the sonorous green jaspers that are found near Cuzco and give forth a note of singular sweetness . He had painted gourds filled with pebbles that rattled when they were shaken ; the long clarin of the Mexicans , into which the performer does not blow , but through which he inhales the air ; the harsh ture of the Amazon tribes , that is sounded by the sentinels who sit all day long in high trees , and can be heard , it is said , at a distance of three leagues ; the teponaztli , that has two vibrating tongues of wood and is beaten with sticks that are smeared with an elastic gum obtained from the milky juice of plants ; the yotl-bells of the Aztecs , that are hung in clusters like grapes ; and a huge cylindrical drum , covered with the skins of great serpents , like the one that Bernal Diaz saw when he went with Cortes into the Mexican temple , and of whose doleful sound he has left us so vivid a description . The fantastic character of these instruments fascinated him , and he felt a curious delight in the thought that art , like Nature , has her monsters , things of bestial shape and with hideous voices . Yet , after some time , he wearied of them , and would sit in his box at the opera , either alone or with Lord Henry , listening in rapt pleasure to “ Tannhauser ” and seeing in the prelude to that great work of art a presentation of the tragedy of his own soul . On one occasion he took up the study of jewels , and appeared at a costume ball as Anne de Joyeuse , Admiral of France , in a dress covered with five hundred and sixty pearls . This taste enthralled him for years , and , indeed , may be said never to have left him . He would often spend a whole day settling and resettling in their cases the various stones that he had collected , such as the olive-green chrysoberyl that turns red by lamplight , the cymophane with its wirelike line of silver , the pistachio-coloured peridot , rose-pink and wine-yellow topazes , carbuncles of fiery scarlet with tremulous , four-rayed stars , flame-red cinnamon-stones , orange and violet spinels , and amethysts with their alternate layers of ruby and sapphire . He loved the red gold of the sunstone , and the moonstone ’ s pearly whiteness , and the broken rainbow of the milky opal . He procured from Amsterdam three emeralds of extraordinary size and richness of colour , and had a turquoise de la vieille roche that was the envy of all the connoisseurs . My attention was first directed to the subject of odours , as connected with colour , during - my attendance at the anatomical rooms in the winter session 1830 - 1831 . During the earlier part of that winter I generally wore a light olive-coloured dress ; but happening one day to attend the rooms in black clothes , I was not a little struck by the almost intolerable smell they had acquired . The smell was so very strong as to be remarked even by the family at home , and it was recognised on the same piece of dress for several days . No odour to the same extent had been remarked in the lighter-coloured clothes . The fetid smell which they more or less acquired in the atmosphere of the rooms was comparatively trifling , and slight exposure to the air alone was necessary to deprive them of the odour which they had thus contracted . This circumstance led me to begin a series of experiments , to ascertain , if possible , why different cloths of nearly the same texture , but not of the same colour , should attract odours in proportions so very different . The result was , as I had ventured to conjecture , that the colour of bodies , independent of the nature of the substance , modifies in a striking manner the capability of surfaces for imbibing and giving out odours . 1 . I inclosed black and white wool , ten grains of each , in a vessel with a small piece of camphor , and kept it carefully secluded from the light . When examined six hours afterwards , it was at once evident to the sense of smell that the black wool had attracted more of the odorous particles than the white wool , though neither had gained any appreciable weight . 2 . I took equal weights of black and white wool , and put them in a small drawer along with a piece of assafcetida ; in twenty-four hours the black wool had contracted a strong odour of the gum , while in the white wool , the smell was scarcely perceptible . 3 . To try the effect of odours upon a vegetable substance , I took equal quantities of black and white cotton wool , and inclosed them with assafoetida . Two similar quantities were at the same time exposed to the emanations of camphor in another drawer . In both the black-coloured cotton had attracted the greatest quantity of odorous particles , as palpably evidenced by the smell . These experiments were made in the month of April 1831 ; but it was not till August following that I had an opportunity of extending the investigation to other colours . 4 . I inclosed equal weights of black , red , and white wool , in a drawer with assafcetida ; and similar quantities of these coloured wools in another drawer with camphor . The result was as before . The black in both experiments had attracted by far the greatest quantity of odorous particles , as evidenced to smell ; the red next followed in point of intensity of smell ; and the white , so far as could be judged , had attracted least of the odour . 5 . The same experiments were tried on cotton of similar colours , and with the same results . Circumstances prevented me from resuming these investigations till the summer of 1832 , when I repeated the experiments with a greater variety of coloured substances , in wool , cotton , and silk , and satisfied not only myself but many of my friends , that odour was attracted nearly in the same ratio as caloric , by coloured substances . The experiments were conducted in the same manner as the preceding . 6 . I inclosed six different-coloured wools , an equal weight of each , viz . black , blue , green , red , yellow , and white , with assafoetida . They were ranged circularly round the odorous body , without touching it or one another , and were then covered over and excluded from the light . At the end of twenty - four hours they were examined . The black was found to have much the strongest smell of assafoetida ; the blue the next ; after that the red , and then the green ; the yellow had but little smell , and the wrhite scarcely any . 7 . A similar experiment , using camphor instead of assafoetida , afforded precisely the same results . 8 . Various coloured cottons were treated in the same manner . In all these the smell was invariably found to be of corresponding intensity , according to the colour , as in the wools . 9 . Silks of different colours gave the same results . 10 . I next endeavoured to ascertain the comparative power of vegetable and animal substances , so far as regards their influence over odours . This was a much more delicate point to ascertain with sufficient accuracy , and free from fallacy , as it was difficult to obtain wool of the same degree of fineness as cotton , the substances I generally preferred for these experiments . I first inclosed equal weights of black and white wool , and black and white cotton , with camphor . After twenty-four hours , the black wool had acquired a stronger smell than the cotton of similar colour ; the white wool had also taken up more of the odorous particles than the white cotton , though the odour in both was very feeble . 11 . When assafoetida was used in a similar experiment , the odour was much more distinguishable , and it could at once be distinguished by smell , that the wool had taken up much more of the odour than the cotton . Indeed , from many experiments I have made to ascertain this fact , wool appears to have a peculiar attraction for fetid odours . For instance , if , after having allowed wool to lie in contact with camphor for some time , it be afterwards placed , even for a very few hours , near a minute portion of sulphuret of barium ( which , it is well known , exhales copiously the fetid odour of sulphuretted hydrogen , ) it quickly loses the camphorous smell , and acquires and even retains in considerable intensity the fetid smell of the sulphuret . It is proper to mention , that in most of these experiments I did not trust to my own olfactory organs alone . All the members of the family , and several of my friends , have lent their aid to distinguish between the different intensities of the odour which each substance had attracted ; and though only a few experiments are here detailed , similar ones have been many times performed , with various other odorous substances . The whole of these in their general results seemed to establish the fact , that the colour of substances exerted a peculiar influence over the absorption of odours . In all these experiments , however , reliance had to be placed upon one sense alone , viz . that of smell , as none of the substances employed had gained any appreciable weight . I was therefore desirous , that , if possible , at least one experiment should be devised , which would show , by the evidence of actual increase of weight , that one colour invariably attracted more of any odorous substance than another ; and upon considering the various odorous substances which could be easily volatilized without change , and whose odour was inseparable from the substance , I fixed upon camphor as the one best suited to my purpose . In an experiment of this nature , it was necessary that the camphor should be volatilized or converted into vapour , and that the coloured substances should be so placed as to come in contact with the camphor while in that state . TITLE X . Of Terrestrial Steams in the Air . INquiring of an ingenious Acquaintance of mine , who , in an inclosed Scope of Ground , has several Veins of differing Metals and Minerals , whether he did not see , and sometimes smell Steams ascending out of this or that Spot of his Ground , in Circumstances where their Ascension could not be imputed to the Action of the Sun ? He and his Son , who was also a Virtuoso , told me , that they had divers times seen as \\' twere Pillars of Fumes ascending like Smoak , whereof some would be inodorous , some ill-scented , and some , though but seldom , well-scented . And you may have observed , as well as I , that Fogs , some of which I have known to be very lasting , and to have a large Spread , did require no tender Nostrils to perceive them to stink . I have frequently observed the smoaking Steams that arose out of the Shafts of Mines not wrought in : And it is certain , the Charcoal made in Cornwal ( especially of that Wood that grows in the Mineral Part thereof ) doth afford a manifest Arsenical and Sulphureous Smell beyond other Charcoal . N . Tel est par exemple ce nuage horrible d\\'une fumée * epaisse qui s\\'eleva de la mer de Crete au Commencement de l\\'Este de l\\'an 721 . et qui s\\'etant repandu dans l\\'air le fit paroistre tout en feu . La mer n\\'en fut pas mesme exempte ; car les grosses masses de pierres enflammées qu\\'on en vit sortier , et qui se joignirent a l\\'Isle qu \\' on nomme Hiera , échauferent si fort les eaux qu\\'elles en bruloient les mains . TITLE XI . Of Salts in the Air . \\' TIS sufficiently known that the Peripatetick Schools teach the Air to be an Element warm and moist ; and if it be an Element , it ought , according to their Principles , and those of the greatest part of other Naturalists , to be a simple and Homogeneous Body . But because such an elementary or uniform Purity is much easier to be found in the Writings of Schoolmen , than amongst the Works of Nature , many of the modern Philosophers have justly forsaken this Doctrine of the elementary Simplicity of the Air in some measure ; but perhaps very few of them , if any , have asserted the Air to be so exceedingly compounded a Body , as in my Opinion it really is . For divers of them grant indeed , that the Atmosphere is not absolutely pure , but yet think , that it differs but gradually from true and simple Air , as Water a little moved and troubled does from clear and settled Water . Of the Molucco Jles . THey are numbred five . Molucco . Gillolo . Ternate . Tidore . and Mahan ( where Magellan after his long voyage Anno 1520 lost his life by treachery of these barbarians . ) The English were the first that ever tradd to these Iles of any Christians : and most of them have acknowledg \\' d our King their Sovereigne : but by the Duch it seemes our men are now thrust out , as if all India were theirs by title from the Creation . Of these Gillolo is greatest ; but in Cloves , Mace , Nutmegs , Ginger , Pepper , Oyle , Aloes , and Honey , all of them alike plentifull . All or most of these , have the Equinoctiall for their Zenyth , and by those diurnall showres , and breezes which faile them not , and Apolloes commorance , the the fruits ripen sooner , the earth smells more aromaticall , and the Ayre seemes more nutritive than in other places . Let us rest a little upon some fruit descriptions . * The Clove tree differs in proportion according to the place it receives vigor in : some being comparable to the Bay , others to Box or such like trees of humble stature ; \\' tis , most part of the yeere green and pleasant , having leaves long and small , distending into many branches : It blossmes early , and becomes exceeding inconstant in complexion ; from a virgin white palliating other colours : in the morne a pale green , in the meridian a distempered red , & sleepes in blacknesse . The Cloves manifest themselves at the utmost end of all the branches in great plenty ; and in their growng evaporate such sense ravishing odours , as if a compendium of Natures sweetest gums and delicacies were extracted and here uunited : they are thrice yeerly pruined , and gratefully retort a treble vintage : and though but perfected in 3 yeares , yet must be counted an advantage ; for Physitins tell us , they are hot and drie in the third degree , corroborate the stoack , and benefit concoction . * The Nutmegg ( or great Nut ) like those trees most famous for their exllencies , is not very lofty in its heigth , scarce so proper as the Cherrie ; by some , resembled to the Peach , with which it varies in forme of leafe and graine , affecting more assize and compasse . The Nut is cloathed with a defensive husk like those of baser quality , but at full ripenesse disroabs it selfe , and discovers her naked purity the Mace , which chastely intwines ( with a vermilliion blush or colour ) her endeared fruit and sister , both of them breathing out most pleasing smells and perfumes : the Mace in few dayes ( like choisest beauties ) by Apolloes wanton flames becom \\' s tawny and unlike her former braverie : yet in that dissent , best pleases the rustick gatherer . Neere the Molucco \\' s , and neerer the Antartique , wee see many other Iles , noble in esteeme , and rich in qualitie : but , for that more than bararous basenesse our miserable Country-men suffered by the Dutch , we have no pleasure to stand upon any thing save recitall ; such are Amboyna , ( placed \\' twixt Banda and Molucso : ) Banda , ( in 4 , degrees 30 minutes , and ( from Amboyna 24 leagues : ) Puloway , ( from Banda 3 leagues : ) Puloreen , ( from Puloway W.N.W . ) Lantore , ( the greatest of the Iles of Banda : ) Baan : Labatacka , Nero , Ticobassa , Cumber , Salame , and others : all of them , especially Puloway and Puloreen , seeming continued wildernesses of Nutegs and Clove-trees , Pepper , Vines , and Olives . These two last named commerced first with our Merchants , and contracted a perpetuall Amity and Fealty to our King ; but in despight of them and us , the uncivill Dutch ( whom for their braving humours here , pride , hate , and bloody execuion of our innocent men at Amboyna and other places in India , I cannot name with patience ) have banisht our Merchants , and entitle themselves Lords of most of Banda Ilands , caring neither what right the Tarnatensian nor Banda Kings have over them . From these , steer wee another course , to Borneo a great and wealthy Iland . We are soone in sight of it , the gale is so prosperous . Of Borneo . BORNEO , or insula bonae fortunoe in Ptol . is Nadyr to the Aequator ; and resembles an ovall shield ; the major part inclining North : Antartick elevation not mounting above 3 degrees ; Artick , to 7 and odde minutes : & owes her first discovery ( by any Christian European ) to one de Bren , who in the yeere of our blessed Lord 1523 . anchored here . It groanes at this day , ( for the most part ) under Spanish bondage ; who in any place where gold or other treasure is to bee had , cease not till they can master it ; vaewing neither soule nor body of any Inhabitant , ( save for their lust ) with the least weight of that too much soule-confounding creature . But let us consider ! Nulla Coelum reparabile gaza . It has many Villages and people ; but the one are poore in their maeriall ; the other more wretched in their infernall Religion , and late taught Idolatry : both , no way valewable ; did not those mynes of Gold and Dyamonds , and some other merchandises ; as , Bezarrs , Musk , Amer , Lignum Aloes , Sanguis Draconûm , Wax , Rice , and Rattans or Canes make her most magneticall . Her marittim Townes and Ports exceed not for number , but Peu & bon . Socodania , ( in 1 deg . 35 minutes South , from Bantam N . E . 160 leagues ) and Bemermassin ; Little , but good , if such thou interpret . Safety and Satiety . We are landed in so good a place , that wee will rest our wearied feet awhile , and entertaine your curiosity with a few viands ; friends ( though simple food ) to infeobled Nature . Bezar , Lignum Aloes , Musk , Civit , Benjamin , and Amber . Bezar , or ( as the Persians call it ) Pezar , is of two sorts ; generated in Persia and both the Indyes : the American is worse than be these of Asia and the Orient . The shape also is various ; some resembling a plum , some a Date-stone , others like Egges of Doves , some like Cheznuts , and Goats kidnies ; all agree in this , they are blunt ended : they are no lesse incontant and divers in colour ; some being red , pale-greene some , other-some of a dark yellow , and some sky-coloured : the last are best , these consistng of many skales ( like Unions and Onions ) circumvolving one the other , and in which . Nature has exprest farre more excellency , than Arts best inenuity or perfection : for , each inferior skale ( not unlike the glorious Orbes inverted ) yeelds fresher beauty , and more celestiall splendor than the former : each skale diminishing & being of more vertue , as the Bezar is in tenuity or crassitude . Many are counterfeit . They try them thus , either by pearcing them with hot bodkins ; or after they have wayd them , to steep them in cold water foure houres ; and if it crack not , tis not feyned : to know it good , they then , wipe it , and ballance it againe ; observing , if it weigh never so little above the first weight , \\' tis base and despicable . Note also , that Borneo Bezars are not halfe so valewable as Persia \\' s . Lignum Aloes , from diversity of Countries , varie in their Nomenclatins . The Javans and Malayans name it , Garroo : Indians and Portuguizes , D \\' Aquillha , the Chinae , and Cochinchinae , Calamba : fram \\' d of large round sticks , of a cloody graine , commixt with ashy veines ; no lesse pleasant to the eye , than to the hand ponderous : the relish or taste proves bitter , in its language telling you , It would be burned ; for , hot coales of Fyre no sooner touch it , but it incendiates , and ( to the honour of its owne Funeall solemnity ) expires and breaths out an odor so aromatick and comforble , that no other is used by the Indians , Malayans , Siamites , Peguans ; Cambogians , and Borneans , when they incinerate the Carcasses of their most honoured Parents . Musk , is either yellow , browne , or black : the first is best , last is basest : the choysest yellow shews a deep Amber complection ( not unlike Spikeard ) cloathed with a reasonable moist skin , sweating out some bristly hayres , without stones , lead , or like adulterate mixtures ; of so strong a smell as seemes offensive ; but tasted , penetrates a strong braine by its fraor : sweet spices dead it ; and put in the mouth , if it suddenly dissolve , or in the hand if it be long a melting ; those trialls discover it for bad and imperfect . Civit , is diversified in colour also : deep yellow ( I have beene told ) is best , the worst is white , gerasie and sophisticat : how beit , the new is pale , and soone after groweth yellowish . Benjamin , by the Malayans call \\' d Menyan ; by other Indians Benyan : is either pure cleare white , or yellow , streaked or coloured ; the gum issues from a tree high , small , and furnished with fruitlesse branches ; the leaves are not unlike the Olive : Pegu and Siam yeelds the best ; Arabia very good ; that from Sumatra , Priaman and Barrouse , course , and had : better lik \\' d of at Iava , than in England . Amber , is of so many formes ; grey , browne , white , black : grey is best ; black is worst ; the other two are indifferent . The best sort of grey is pure , interlac \\' t with ashie veines , not subject to sinck ; and got ( as Merhants informe us ) in Soffala , Magadoxa , Mombassa , Mosambique , Madagasar Mohelia , Melinde , other parts of Afrique : found there at incertain Snuff Perfum \\' d with Flowers . THE Flowers much used for Perfuming Snuff , are Orange-flower water , Jasmin , common Roses , musqued Roses and Tuberoses , other Flowers can hardly Perfume naturally , unless you use a great quantity of them , and add to them some Essence of the same Flowers , as you \\' ll see in the Receipts for Perfuming Snuff ; but when all is done the smell never last long , as in other Perfumes . Here is the manner how to use them in Perfuming Snuff . Get a Wooden Box , as big as you have occasion for , line within with dry Paper , lay in it a Bed of Snuff an Inch thick , then a Bed of Flowers , and so along till you have no more of it ; let it lay so in the Flowers Twenty four Hours : then searce your Snuff , to take out the Flowers , and renew them at the same time ; continue so doing four or five days ; and when you think your Snuff is Perfum \\' d enough with Flowers , keep it very close in your Boxes , in a very dry place ; don \\' t meddle with it when the Flowers are within , because it will not heat . Another manner of Perfuming Snuff with Flowers . GET a good quantity of Sheets of Paper dryed before the Fire , of the bigness and shape or thereabouts of your Boxes ; prick them all over with a big Pin ; then to Perfume your Snuff with Flowers , lay a Bed of them an Inch thick in the Box ; and over one Sheet of that Paper , and over the Paper a Bed of Flowers , and another sheet of Paper over the Flowers ; lay over that sheet another Bed of Snuff , and continue so doing till you have none left : So the Flowers are between two Papers , and the Snuff too , without touching the Flowers ; and by that means the Snuff takes naturally the Smell of the Flowers , because the same Smell is not corrupted or alter \\' d by the Snuff . Change your Flowers according to the Plenty you have of them ; and when you take them out , take up only the sheets of Paper , and pass your Snuff through a fine hair Sieve to let your Snuff through and keep in the Flowers . Flower it so four or five days , and \\' tis done . Snuff perfum \\' d with Buds of Roses . TAKE as much Buds of Roses as you will , pluck out the green knots , and in their room put as many Cloves : Then throw them in a Glass-bottle well stopt , expose the Bottle to the hot sun three Weeks or a Month ; you may use them after to perfume your Snuff , being cleansed they will give a very sweet Smell to it . Snuff perfum \\' d with a great many sorts of Flowers . NOthing else is to be done , but to mix together Snuff perfum \\' d with several sweet Flowers , and to prepare it so well by more or less of it , that you can hardly discern which Smell prevails , and \\' tis done . The manner of making Snuff in Grains of different bigness . GET several sorts of Sieves , some of thin others of very thick Cloth , and so according to the courseness of your Cloth , you \\' ll make the Grains of your Snuff in passing it through ; you must not searce it but when it is perfum \\' d with Flowers . Fine Spanish Snuff . THE true Spanish Snuff is very fine and redish , to make it take red Snuff in Grains , beat it in a Mortar , and pass it very fine through a Sieve ; and being cleansed before it is colour \\' d , as I prescribe in the beginning of this Treatise , perfume it only with Flowers , then with some Spanish Perfume or other , and \\' tis done . To perfume Snuff well , it is not enough to perfume it with Flowers , you must use other Perfumes ; it is true , being only perfum \\' d with Flowers , it may be good to be perfumed with the Perfumes we mention hereafter : I leave it to every ones Fancy , I \\' ll say only this , That the Smell of Flowers does very well , mixt with the most sweet and precious Smells , and that they are of a stronger and more lasting Vertue . They make an excellent fire — bright , clear , and free from blaze , and particularly suited for broiling , and for burning refuse . One of the difficulties associated with the burning of refuse is that servants say they cannot dispose of it thus because it makes a bad smell . If , however , the mistress will insist upon having it burnt in small quantities at a time , as it is produced , have it put on the fire when the latter is low , but before it gets dull , and then covered with cinders and a little damp coaldust , and it will burn away without causing any bad smell . It is when rubbish is allowed to accumulate , and when the attempt is made to burn a quantity at once , that the fire goes out , and an unpleasant odour is created . With a little management , everything that cannot bo used may be burnt either at the copper fire or the kitchen fire — bones ( broken up ) , tea-leaves , fragments , and everything else ; and as a result , instead of bad smells being produced , they will be avoided ; because damp refuse put into a dust-bin very speedily ferments or decomposes , and causes a smell which is dangerous as welt as unpleasant , and is the cause of cholera and typhoid ; while refuse burnt is rendered quite harmless . The author ’ s attention having been long directed to the remarkable fact , that odour , resembling that of phosphorus , is given off during the escape of positive electricity from the point of a conductor into air ; and is likewise perceptible when lightning has struck any object , and also when water is electrolyzed , he has investigated the circumstances attending these phenomena ; and the results he has obtained will , he expects , afford a clue to the discovery of their cause . The odour which accompanies the electrolyzation of water , he observes , is only disengaged at the positive electrode . He also finds that the odoriferous principle can be preserved in well-closed glass bottles for any length of time . The only metals which yield this odour are gold and platina ; but dilute sulphuric , phosphoric , and nitric acids , and from aqueous solutions of several of the salts , also disengage it . Raising the temperature of the fluid to the boiling point prevents the odour from arising ; and the addition of comparatively small quantities of powdered charcoal , iron , zinc , tin , lead , antimony , bismuth or arsenic , or of a few drops of mercury , to the odorous principle contained in a bottle , immediately destroys the smell ; and the same happens when platina or gold , heated red hot , is introduced into the vessel containing that volatile substance . 30 : 29 And thou shalt sanctify them , that they may be most holy : whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy . 30 : 30 And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons , and consecrate them , that they may minister unto me in the priest ’ s office . 30 : 31 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel , saying , This shall be an holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations . 30 : 32 Upon man ’ s flesh shall it not be poured , neither shall ye make any other like it , after the composition of it : it is holy , and it shall be holy unto you . 30 : 33 Whosoever compoundeth any like it , or whosoever putteth any of it upon a stranger , shall even be cut off from his people . 30 : 34 And the LORD said unto Moses , Take unto thee sweet spices , stacte , and onycha , and galbanum ; these sweet spices with pure frankincense : of each shall there be a like weight : 30 : 35 And thou shalt make it a perfume , a confection after the art of the apothecary , tempered together , pure and holy : 30 : 36 And thou shalt beat some of it very small , and put of it before the testimony in the tabernacle of the congregation , where I will meet with thee : it shall be unto you most holy . 30 : 37 And as for the perfume which thou shalt make , ye shall not make to yourselves according to the composition thereof : it shall be unto thee holy for the LORD . 30 : 38 Whosoever shall make like unto that , to smell thereto , shall even be cut off from his people . 31 : 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying , 31 : 2 See , I have called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri , the son of Hur , of the tribe of Judah : 31 : 3 And I have filled him with the spirit of God , in wisdom , and in understanding , and in knowledge , and in all manner of workmanship , 31 : 4 To devise cunning works , to work in gold , and in silver , and in brass , 31 : 5 And in cutting of stones , to set them , and in carving of timber , to work in all manner of workmanship . 31 : 6 And I , behold , I have given with him Aholiab , the son of Ahisamach , of the tribe of Dan : and in the hearts of all that are wise hearted I have put wisdom , that they may make all that I have commanded thee ; 31 : 7 The tabernacle of the congregation , and the ark of the testimony , and the mercy seat that is thereupon , and all the furniture of the tabernacle , 31 : 8 And the table and his furniture , and the pure candlestick with all his furniture , and the altar of incense , 31 : 9 And the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture , and the laver and his foot , 31 : 10 And the cloths of service , and the holy garments for Aaron the priest , and the garments of his sons , to minister in the priest ’ s office , 31 : 11 And the anointing oil , and sweet incense for the holy place : according to all that I have commanded thee shall they do . The next accident of vrine is the qualitie : and the qualities , as witnesseth Mercuriale , according to the doctrine of the Arabian Physitians , are fiue : the smell , the tast , the sound , the touch , and the colour . As for the smell , vrines haue little or no smell , or else a sweet and pleasing smell , or finally a stinking smell . No smell , saith Mercuriall , proceedeth from no other cause then from the extinguishing of naturall heate : howbeit it may sometimes proceed from drinke of a cold qualitie , like as we see in cold countries , and the like complexions , the smell of the vrine is not so much to be discerned . rines smell well , either in regard of diet or drugs : but especially by meanes of a temperate heate concocting well . Stinking vrines come by foure seuerall meanes . 1 . By meanes of cruditie and indigestion of the food . 2 . By reason of putrefaction . Galen witnesseth , that whatsoeuer thing is putrified hath an euill fauoured smell.Wherefore in Pestilentiall feauers the vrines are most commonly of a stinking smell . As also if the vrines passe through any place oppressed with putrid vlcers ; or yet if any purulent matter be mingled with them , they become stinking . 3 . The too long retention of vrine in the bladder may make it to stinke . 4 . The qualitie either of diet or drugs , ( as hath bene said of the good smell of vrines ) may likewise procure vnto it an euill smell . Looke at large what Sauonarola saith of this point , if thou be disposed to see further . But what certaintie doth the smell of the vrine affoord vs ? whosoeuer shall thinke to helpe his vncertaine coniectures by the same , should leape out of the frying pan ( as the prouerbe saith ) into the fire . In the first place it is to be obserued , that as well in sicknesse as in health , vrines may offer no pleasing smell to the nose , and yet the party may be free from any danger at al . But because healthfull folkes seldome send their vrines to the Physitian , we will let them passe , and come to the sicke . I will let Scribonius speake for me . Concerning the sicks vrine ( saith he ) most do teach vs that stinking vrines signifie putrefaction of humours , in so much that by the difference of the smels , they take vpon them to iudge of the seuerall humours so putrified . O wise woodcockes ! I willingly yeeld to them , that stinke or strong smell doth argue putrefaction in such vrines : but of which parts shall this putrefaction be ? whether of the bladder onely , or of the Liuer also , of the chest , or other members ? Nay so farre off is the stinking smell from giuing vs any particular notice of the disease , that it cannot so much as affoord vs any certaine generall knowledge of the same . For many sweet smelling simples ( saith Montanus ) may cause a most stinking vrine . Cholericke and hote complexioned men void often very strong smelling vrines , howsoeuer free fro ? any disease , as I haue often obserued in my selfe . And by what meanes , I pray thee , shouldst thou from the stinking smell of the vrine know putrefaction ? or how can this putrefaction procure this stinking smell ? If this were so , then would it necessarily follow , that whosoeuer were seised with a feauer proceeding from putrefaction of humours , should voyd stinking vrines , the which is most false . The truth of this assumption may from hence appeare , that for the most part among an hundred sicke of such feauers , scarce shalt thou find one of their vrines so to smell , nor yet their bloud at the opening of a veine . And for this cause well said Sauonarola in his treatise of Vrines , that there are other signes also to be obserued in the annoying of putrified members , if we purpose well and orderly to examine , trie and finde out any skill concerning vrines . And indeed a thousand causes there are which may alter and change their smell . By the smell then onely there can neuer be any certaintie collected to informe our iudgements concerning any disease . But I am afraid the Reader will take it ill , that I so long detaine him among so vnpleasing smels ; and my selfe begin to waxe wearie of so vnworthie a thing , and as I neuer tooke any pleasure in the same , so here I leaue it to them that like it better . But if I should yet enter vpon the tast , I feare I should be worse taxed . I can tell no man their tast by mine owne experience . Salt they haue alwayes bene counted , as the teares likewise : If any be incredulous I will not hinder him . If our vrinemongers had no better beere allowed them , they would not so much adore the pissepot as some of them do . But yet if any purpose to practise this point , I wish him to go to the Arabians , who haue written so curiously concerning this point ; and it may be , in regard of their aromaticall drugs , their vrines may be of better taste then those of our Europaeans , who feed on grosser food . As for the other two qualities , the sound and touch , we will send them all in one ship to Arabia with their fellowes : and now we come to the colours . It will be readily seen that night-time is the most favourable for the retention of scent , as evaporation does not take place so rapidly then , and this , of course , as I have shown , is why dogs are more especially useful at this time . It is even possible to track a fairly recent trail on certain roads at night in spite of the hard surface , and a quite recent trail on pavement , always supposing these have not been fouled too much by other footsteps . Strongly scented ground makes tracking difficult , as the animal or human scent is overpowered : thus clover fields , or any highly scented crops , and manured fields , are decided drawbacks . Newly ploughed fields are unprofitable tracking-ground , the reason being that the turned - up earth has a strong aromatic odour of its own , apart from that of the chemicals , & c . , that may have been previously put into it . Now with regard to the scent left by a man , much interesting speculation arises as to whether the dog works entirely by foot scent , or if he depends as well on body scent , and if so , how much . As yet , all experiments by experts have not to any extent given us a decided answer on this point . I here give an account of some interesting experiments which Dr Romanes carried out . “ On one occasion Dr Romanes put a most intelligent bitch to a crucial test . He walked for fifty yards in his ordinary shooting-boots ; then he walked a hundred yards in his stockings , and completed another hundred yards on his bare feet . The bitch followed the first part of the trail at full speed . “ Changing the experiments , he soaked his ordinary shooting - boots with oil of aniseed , and walked with these over the park . Strange to say , this strong odour did not interfere with the bitch ’ s scent , for it ran him down as quickly as before . “ Accordingly , this keen observer came to the conclusion that his setter distinguished his trail from that of all others by the peculiar smell of his boots , and not by the particular scent of his feet or body . The exudations from his feet required to be combined with shoe-leather , and brown paper can stop the transmission of that scent . ” I give the above quotation with all due deference to such a renowned authority ; but I myself , from my own experiments , am not prepared to accept , without reserve , all he says , as my experience goes to show that a trail run in stockinged feet , or bare feet , is more favourable for tracking than that run in boots . My own opinion is , that the dog goes both by foot scent on the ground and also by body scent , when this latter scent is there , and I think that this is another reason why tracking in the evening or at night is so much easier for the dog . The air at this time being both moist and still , the fugitive ’ s body scent remains suspended in the air as he goes along , and this is a great additional aid to the dog . But it is not to cases such as those now related , numerous as they are , nor to any other of a kindred type , in which diseased action or constitutional peculiarity may be urged as a cause of the serious morbid affections produced , that the evil effects of this nauseous exhalation are confined . Families in which there have been no such serious symptoms produced , but who , from the situation of their residences , are exposed to its influence , have still to endure all the discomfort of an abominable public nuisance when they move abroad , or , when the wind is high , be subjected to its presence in their apartments . In the letter on the subject with which we have been favoured by Dr Mackenzie , from which we have already quoted , the reader will see the extent of the annoyance arising from this civic and domestic plague to the families living in the fashionable neighbourhood in which the doctor resides . “ When I first occupied a house upon this hill ( the Calton ) in 1833 , I found ( or then imagined I did ) that when the wind was from the east or north-east , some disagreeable smells were conveyed by it . In the year following I became convinced that it was so ; bad enough during the influence of easterly winds in March , April , and May , but sickening and almost intolerable in the warm months , when the wind was from the same quarter . Since then , 1834 , till now , 1839 , this nuisance has greatly increased , not alone when inhaling it upon the Terrace , but actually within our rooms , and even when the windows are not open , until at length I have all but resolved to quit a situation which I deem to be the most delightful in Edinburgh as a place of residence , and , I Would add , but for this nuisance , by far the most healthful . Yet I believe our cause of complaint is not confined to the Hill Terrace , but that it extends to Leith Walk , and yet further north ; and if this is so , how far less endurable must it be to the occupants of houses yet nearer to ‘ Stinkomalce ’ than that which I now write from in Carlton Place . ” So distressing is this nuisance to the families resident in that quarter , that on every occasion when the wind blows in the direction of their houses from the marshes and tanks , they are compelled to shut up the windows to prevent the intrusion of this noxious exhalation . The windows on the side of the quadrangle of the Palace of Holy rood contiguous to the Foul Burn and irrigated lands , are regularly closed whenever there is the slightest breath of wind from that quarter , to prevent the apartments from being filled with the effluvium . Complaints like these we have just enumerated have been of long duration , and have only increased from the extension of the nuisance by which they have been caused . At the trial in 1809 , - ^ - to the evidence produced at which we have already referred , — many of the witnesses bore testimony to the misery and discomfort which they suffered from their proximity to the ponds and stagnating waters . Colonel Leathom , of the 4th Dragoon Guards , who had been quartered with his regiment from May 1801 till August 1802 at Piershill Barracks , deponed , “ That he was frequently sensible of a most disagreeable and offensive smell while he was in the barracks , which he was certain proceeded from the stagnant water at Restalrig . On going down to Leith with his regiment on two or three occasions , the stench was so very strong that for the instant it sickened him . There were frequent conversations among the officers respecting this offensive smell , and in particular they expressed their surprise that the barracks should be built so near to such a nuisancer The surprise of the officers of the 4th has been shared , we believe , as already stated , by those of every regiment that ever was quartered in that unwholesome station ; but the wonder ought to be why no attempt has ever been made by the Government authorities to remove the evident and only cause of insalubrity — the surrounding marsh . Mr Scougall , the then proprietor of Marionville , who was also on the trial , appears to have been as much annoyed by this nuisance as his successor of the present day , Mr Glass , whose opinion we have recorded elsewhere . Mr Scougall thus feelingly alludes to the domestic privation he was compelled to endure , and to which the inhabitants of that neighbourhood , and all the contiguous districts of Edinburgh , are still subjected , and in a greatly augmented form . Mr S . deponed , “ That he can say , in the strongest terms , that the comfort of himself and family is lessened by the vicinity of these ponds . His family have sometimes in the summer to keep their windows shut , in order to exclude the bad smell from these ponds . ” The Rev . Robert Walker , at that time minister of the Canongate Church , another of the witnesses , deponed , “ That many a time he had felt a smell offensive in a very high degree in the grounds of Marionville to the south of the house , insomuch as to sicken him ; and particularly once , at the foot of the garden , where he felt so very offensive a smell that it sickened him , and l he was unwell for two days . ” Although from their situation the inhabitants of certain districts of the town are more exposed to this nuisance than others , there is no district entirely exempt from its effects . Encircling , as these irrigated fields do , nearly three fourths of our landward frontier , there is no ingress or egress to or from the City without encountering the annoyance . Half the pleasure-walks in the neighbourhood are deteriorated by its presence . However much the beauty of the surrounding natural scenery may delight the fancy , and its green verdure please the eye , the insupportable odour for ever present in the atmosphere inevitably destroys and dissipates all enjoyment . To all classes in their out-door recreations this nuisance is a source of intolerable annoyance ; but the poor are perhaps more under its influence than the wealthier classes , as from their circumstances they cannot command the same amount of locomotive power . To the latter a few miles of space is comparatively nothing , as it can be readily passed , and the open country attained , where an uncorrupted soil and a oure atmosphere are to be met with , ready to contribute to their renvigoration and pleasure . But with the poor mechanic and his family he case is sadly reversed . They must necessarily confine their pronenade within a narrower range , and seek , as it were , on the very ; erge of this Lernian marsh , that health which its putrid effluvia for ) id them to enjoy . To this class of the community , unless the toil ind expense of an absolute journey be undertaken , there is no avoidng the nuisance — no procuring the enjoyment of a pleasure-walk , ffemmed in on every side by a smoking fen , there seems no outlet > ut the pinnacle of Arthur Seat , for the lower summit of the Calyon Hill affords him no immunity from this annoyance of the all-prealent enemy . The passengers by public conveyance are annoyed to an equal exent , and the nuisance forms a never-ending subject of complaint and xecration among the company of the railway train and stage-coaches idiich have to pass through or within the margin of the fetid marsh , dr Rankin , the superintendent of the railway , informs us , “ that ie , or the officers employed by him , have almost constant opportulities of hearing the passengers lamenting the grievous nuisance to rhich so populous a neighbourhood is exposed . ” One thing I could not help observing : what befell one of the quacks , who published that he had a most excellent preservative against the plague , which whoever kept about them should never be infected or liable to infection . This man , who , we may reasonably suppose , did not go abroad without some of this excellent preservative in his pocket , yet was taken by the distemper , and carried off in two or three days . I am not of the number of the physic-haters or physic-despisers ; on the contrary , I have often mentioned the regard I had to the dictates of my particular friend Dr Heath ; but yet I must acknowledge I made use of little or nothing—except , as I have observed , to keep a preparation of strong scent to have ready , in case I met with anything of offensive smells or went too near any burying-place or dead body . Neither did I do what I know some did : keep the spirits always high and hot with cordials and wine and such things ; and which , as I observed , one learned physician used himself so much to as that he could not leave them off when the infection was quite gone , and so became a sot for all his life after . I remember my friend the doctor used to say that there was a certain set of drugs and preparations which were all certainly good and useful in the case of an infection ; out of which , or with which , physicians might make an infinite variety of medicines , as the ringers of bells make several hundred different rounds of music by the changing and order or sound but in six bells , and that all these preparations shall be really very good : ‘ Therefore , ’ said he , ‘ I do not wonder that so vast a throng of medicines is offered in the present calamity , and almost every physician prescribes or prepares a different thing , as his judgement or experience guides him ; but ’ , says my friend , ‘ let all the prescriptions of all the physicians in London be examined , and it will be found that they are all compounded of the same things , with such variations only as the particular fancy of the doctor leads him to ; so that ’ , says he , ‘ every man , judging a little of his own constitution and manner of his living , and circumstances of his being infected , may direct his own medicines out of the ordinary drugs and preparations . Only that ’ , says he , ‘ some recommend one thing as most sovereign , and some another . Some ’ , says he , ‘ think that pill . ruff . , which is called itself the anti-pestilential pill is the best preparation that can be made ; others think that Venice treacle is sufficient of itself to resist the contagion ; and I ’ , says he , ‘ think as both these think , viz . , that the last is good to take beforehand to prevent it , and the first , if touched , to expel it . ’ According to this opinion , I several times took Venice treacle , and a sound sweat upon it , and thought myself as well fortified against the infection as any one could be fortified by the power of physic . As for quackery and mountebanks , of which the town was so full , I listened to none of them , and have observed often since , with some wonder , that for two years after the plague I scarcely saw or heard of one of them about town . Some fancied they were all swept away in the infection to a man , and were for calling it a particular mark of God ’ s vengeance upon them for leading the poor people into the pit of destruction , merely for the lucre of a little money they got by them ; but I cannot go that length neither . That abundance of them died is certain—many of them came within the reach of my own knowledge—but that all of them were swept off I much question . I believe rather they fled into the country and tried their practices upon the people there , who were in apprehension of the infection before it came among them . This , however , is certain , not a man of them appeared for a great while in or about London . There were , indeed , several doctors who published bills recommending their several physical preparations for cleansing the body , as they call it , after the plague , and needful , as they said , for such people to take who had been visited and had been cured ; whereas I must own I believe that it was the opinion of the most eminent physicians at that time that the plague was itself a sufficient purge , and that those who escaped the infection needed no physic to cleanse their bodies of any other things ; the running sores , the tumours , & c . , which were broke and kept open by the directions of the physicians , having sufficiently cleansed them ; and that all other distempers , and causes of distempers , were effectually carried off that way ; and as the physicians gave this as their opinions wherever they came , the quacks got little business . There were , indeed , several little hurries which happened after the decrease of the plague , and which , whether they were contrived to fright and disorder the people , as some imagined , I cannot say , but sometimes we were told the plague would return by such a time ; and the famous Solomon Eagle , the naked Quaker I have mentioned , prophesied evil tidings every day ; and several others telling us that London had not been sufficiently scourged , and that sorer and severer strokes were yet behind . Had they stopped there , or had they descended to particulars , and told us that the city should the next year be destroyed by fire , then , indeed , when we had seen it come to pass , we should not have been to blame to have paid more than a common respect to their prophetic spirits ; at least we should have wondered at them , and have been more serious in our inquiries after the meaning of it , and whence they had the foreknowledge . But as they generally told us of a relapse into the plague , we have had no concern since that about them ; yet by those frequent clamours , we were all kept with some kind of apprehensions constantly upon us ; and if any died suddenly , or if the spotted fevers at any time increased , we were presently alarmed ; much more if the number of the plague increased , for to the end of the year there were always between 200 and 300 of the plague . On any of these occasions , I say , we were alarmed anew . Those who remember the city of London before the fire must remember that there was then no such place as we now call Newgate Market , but that in the middle of the street which is now called Blowbladder Street , and which had its name from the butchers , who used to kill and dress their sheep there ( and who , it seems , had a custom to blow up their meat with pipes to make it look thicker and fatter than it was , and were punished there for it by the Lord Mayor ) ; I say , from the end of the street towards Newgate there stood two long rows of shambles for the selling meat . It was in those shambles that two persons falling down dead , as they were buying meat , gave rise to a rumour that the meat was all infected ; which , though it might affright the people , and spoiled the market for two or three days , yet it appeared plainly afterwards that there was nothing of truth in the suggestion . But nobody can account for the possession of fear when it takes hold of the mind . However , it Pleased God , by the continuing of the winter weather , so to restore the health of the city that by February following we reckoned the distemper quite ceased , and then we were not so easily frighted again . There was still a question among the learned , and at first perplexed the people a little : and that was in what manner to purge the house and goods where the plague had been , and how to render them habitable again , which had been left empty during the time of the plague . Abundance of perfumes and preparations were prescribed by physicians , some of one kind and some of another , in which the people who listened to them put themselves to a great , and indeed , in my opinion , to an unnecessary expense ; and the poorer people , who only set open their windows night and day , burned brimstone , pitch , and gunpowder , and such things in their rooms , did as well as the best ; nay , the eager people who , as I said above , came home in haste and at all hazards , found little or no inconvenience in their houses , nor in the goods , and did little or nothing to them . However , in general , prudent , cautious people did enter into some measures for airing and sweetening their houses , and burned perfumes , incense , benjamin , rozin , and sulphur in their rooms close shut up , and then let the air carry it all out with a blast of gunpowder ; others caused large fires to be made all day and all night for several days and nights ; by the same token that two or three were pleased to set their houses on fire , and so effectually sweetened them by burning them down to the ground ; as particularly one at Ratcliff , one in Holbourn , and one at Westminster ; besides two or three that were set on fire , but the fire was happily got out again before it went far enough to burn down the houses ; and one citizen ’ s servant , I think it was in Thames Street , carried so much gunpowder into his master ’ s house , for clearing it of the infection , and managed it so foolishly , that he blew up part of the roof of the house . But the time was not fully come that the city was to be purged by fire , nor was it far off ; for within nine months more I saw it all lying in ashes ; when , as some of our quacking philosophers pretend , the seeds of the plague were entirely destroyed , and not before ; a notion too ridiculous to speak of here : since , had the seeds of the plague remained in the houses , not to be destroyed but by fire , how has it been that they have not since broken out , seeing all those buildings in the suburbs and liberties , all in the great parishes of Stepney , Whitechappel , Aldgate , Bishopsgate , Shoreditch , Cripplegate , and St Giles , where the fire never came , and where the plague raged with the greatest violence , remain still in the same condition they were in before ? But to leave these things just as I found them , it was certain that those people who were more than ordinarily cautious of their health , did take particular directions for what they called seasoning of their houses , and abundance of costly things were consumed on that account which I cannot but say not only seasoned those houses , as they desired , but filled the air with very grateful and wholesome smells which others had the share of the benefit of as well as those who were at the expenses of them . And yet after all , though the poor came to town very precipitantly , as I have said , yet I must say the rich made no such haste . The men of business , indeed , came up , but many of them did not bring their families to town till the spring came on , and that they saw reason to depend upon it that the plague would not return . The Court , indeed , came up soon after Christmas , but the nobility and gentry , except such as depended upon and had employment under the administration , did not come so soon . I should have taken notice here that , notwithstanding the violence of the plague in London and in other places , yet it was very observable that it was never on board the fleet ; and yet for some time there was a strange press in the river , and even in the streets , for seamen to man the fleet . But it was in the beginning of the year , when the plague was scarce begun , and not at all come down to that part of the city where they usually press for seamen ; and though a war with the Dutch was not at all grateful to the people at that time , and the seamen went with a kind of reluctancy into the service , and many complained of being dragged into it by force , yet it proved in the event a happy violence to several of them , who had probably perished in the general calamity , and who , after the summer service was over , though they had cause to lament the desolation of their families—who , when they came back , were many of them in their graves—yet they had room to be thankful that they were carried out of the reach of it , though so much against their wills . We indeed had a hot war with the Dutch that year , and one very great engagement at sea in which the Dutch were worsted , but we lost a great many men and some ships . But , as I observed , the plague was not in the fleet , and when they came to lay up the ships in the river the violent part of it began to abate . I would be glad if I could close the account of this melancholy year with some particular examples historically ; I mean of the thankfulness to God , our preserver , for our being delivered from this dreadful calamity . Certainly the circumstance of the deliverance , as well as the terrible enemy we were delivered from , called upon the whole nation for it . The circumstances of the deliverance were indeed very remarkable , as I have in part mentioned already , and particularly the dreadful condition which we were all in when we were to the surprise of the whole town made joyful with the hope of a stop of the infection . Nothing but the immediate finger of God , nothing but omnipotent power , could have done it . The contagion despised all medicine ; death raged in every corner ; and had it gone on as it did then , a few weeks more would have cleared the town of all , and everything that had a soul . Men everywhere began to despair ; every heart failed them for fear ; people were made desperate through the anguish of their souls , and the terrors of death sat in the very faces and countenances of the people . In that very moment when we might very well say , ‘ Vain was the help of man ’ , — I say , in that very moment it pleased God , with a most agreeable surprise , to cause the fury of it to abate , even of itself ; and the malignity declining , as I have said , though infinite numbers were sick , yet fewer died , and the very first weeks ’ bill decreased 1843 ; a vast number indeed ! It is impossible to express the change that appeared in the very countenances of the people that Thursday morning when the weekly bill came out . It might have been perceived in their countenances that a secret surprise and smile of joy sat on everybody ’ s face . They shook one another by the hands in the streets , who would hardly go on the same side of the way with one another before . Where the streets were not too broad they would open their windows and call from one house to another , and ask how they did , and if they had heard the good news that the plague was abated . Some would return , when they said good news , and ask , ‘ What good news ? ’ and when they answered that the plague was abated and the bills decreased almost two thousand , they would cry out , ‘ God be praised ! ’ and would weep aloud for joy , telling them they had heard nothing of it ; and such was the joy of the people that it was , as it were , life to them from the grave . I could almost set down as many extravagant things done in the excess of their joy as of their grief ; but that would be to lessen the value of it . CHAP . 12 . IF the putrefaction proceedeth most of the earth or vppermost partes of the earth , as from stinking channells , standing lakes , priuyes , or other polluted places , as dunghills , vncleane kept houses , and such like , then there will be felt many sudden great stinches , and vnsauerie smells , such as cannot be distinguished , or discerned , what it is , or whereof it commeth , because it is confounded , beeing made of diuers stinches : in that yeare there wil be many frogges , toades , venemous wormes , fleas , and flyes . CHAP . 13 . IF the putrefaction proceedeth from within the earth , then venemous beasts and wormes will be seene more commonly aboue the earth , and will breede vpon the earth , and many of them will die . CHAP . 14 . THe putrefaction or virulent matter of infection now , is from celestiall orbes principally , also from corrupt places , partly from corrupt humours in man , begotten by the two former , and ill order in feeding and sleeping , in idlenes and late walking abroad , and sitting vp . CHAP . 15 . THe infection taken at the nostrills is more daungerous then otherwise , because there are two organes or passages that lead to the heart , from thence more , then from the mouth . CHAP . 16 . THe putrified aire cannot passe so speedily to mans heart , as to diuers other creatures by the instrument of smelling , which is couered with a pellicle or filme , which is to be lifted vp before he can smell by the ayre or fume : and that pellicle is grosser in man then in other creatures : and therefore requireth the hotter or stronger fume to mooue it . Secondly , the instrument of smelling is placed deeper in the head , then in any other creatures . Thirdly , the instrument of smelling is nigh the braine in man , which with the moysture doth hinder the naturall complexion of the instrument of smelling , which is hot and drie , attractiue or drawing vnto it . CHAP . 17 . IF the putrefaction in the ayre be more hot then moist , then it is more apt to destroy , and to be taken by the nostrills : first , because the heat is subtile , and passeth vp speedily to the pellicle , and mooueth with the fume or moisture . Secondly , for that the heat doth resist the coldnes and moisture of the braine , the which are hinderers of smelling . CHAP . 18 . The complexion aptest to be infected , is the sanguine , first , because the qualities in that complexion are like vnto the qualities in the ayre , hot and moist , and therefore doth entertaine the ayre the apter . Secondly , because these two qualities in this complexion maketh it more conuertible , like the ayre , which will sooner be made hotter or moister then any of the other elements . Thirdly , because in this complexion , the passages leading to the humours about the heart , and to the vitall spirits in the heart , are more large and spatious then in any other . The reason is , for that blood naturall is not without his vapours , which cause motion , and where most motion of blood is , there is cause of extention , and the same is in this complexion . CHAP . 19 . The aptest time for this complexion to entertaine the virulent matter into the humours , is in the former spring especially : for then blood increaseth , and passeth vp and downe , beeing not thoroughly refined , and made the readier by his motion and impuritie to receiue it . The aptest time for this complexion to entertaine the virulent matter into the spirits vitall is sommer , by reason that the blood beeing made hot , and the spirits likewise hot , and ayre continually heating . The condition of food used and stored upon the premises is a matter of considerable importance and although examination of food is often made , the main responsibility rests upon the manager . A difficulty of a subsidiary character is the objection which neighbouring tenants frequently make to the smells of cooking which occasionally arise . When the nuisance is caused by the burning of refuse of an offensive nature , perhaps this can be dealt with under the Public Health Acts , but where this is simply a cooking smell and affects personal comfort , perhaps the only remedy is an action at common law by the party affected . In previous reports attention has been directed to the fact that restaurant kitchens , being workplaces , may be established without notice of any kind being given , in which respect they differ from factories and workshops . It is not necessary either that such places should be registered , although an attempt is made to keep as complete a register as possible of all kitchens known to exist in the City . It would prove a great advantage to public sanitation if all restaurant kitchens were required to be registered under different conditions of occupation . These conditions should specify the minimum requirements in respect of the matters set out above . SUGGESTION . would suggest that when another Bill is promoted by the Corporation for general purposes that an endeavour be made to obtain additional powers in respect of regulations of kitchens in which food is prepared for consumption by the general public , whether such kitchens are attached to restaurants or to hotels . Including Inspections made by Sanitary Inspectors or Inspectors of Nuisances . Then at last there were lights and houses and men and women passing the windows . They had entered a village . Instantly Flush was all attention . \" . . . his eyes were starting out of his head with eagerness ; he looked east , he looked west , you would conclude that he was taking notes or preparing them . \" It was the human scene that stirred him , not beauty . Beauty , so it seems at least , had to be crystallised into a green or violet powder and puffed by some celestial syringe down the fringed channels that lay behind his nostrils before it touched Flush\\'s senses ; and then it issued not in words , but in a silent rapture . Where Mrs . Browning saw , he smelt ; where she wrote , he snuffed . Here , then , the biographer must perforce come to a pause . Where two or three thousand words are insufficient for what we see - - and Mrs . Browning had to admit herself beaten by the Apennines : \" Of these things I cannot give you any idea , \" she admitted - - there are no more than two words and perhaps one-half for what we smell . The human nose is practically non-existent . The greatest poets in the world have smelt nothing but roses on the one hand , and dung on the other . The infinite gradations that lie between are unrecorded . Yet it was in the world of smell that Flush mostly lived . Love was chiefly smell ; form and colour were smell ; music and architecture , law , politics and science were smell . To him religion itself was smell . To describe his simplest experience with the daily chop or biscuit is beyond our power . Not even Mr . Swinburne could have said what the smell of Wimpole Street meant to Flush on a hot afternoon in June . As for describing the smell of a spaniel mixed with the smell of torches , laurels , incense , banners , wax candles and a garland of rose leaves crushed by a satin heel that has been laid up in camphor , perhaps Shakespeare , had he paused in the middle of writing Antony and Cleopatra - - But Shakespeare did not pause . Confessing our inadequacy , then , we can but note that to Flush Italy , in these the fullest , the freest , the happiest years of his life , meant mainly a succession of smells . Love , it must be supposed , was gradually losing its appeal . Smell remained . Now that they were established in Casa Guidi again , all had their avocations . Mr . Browning wrote regularly in one room ; Mrs . Browning wrote regularly in another . The baby played in the nursery . But Flush wandered off into the streets of Florence to enjoy the rapture of smell . He threaded his path through main streets and back streets , through squares and alleys , by smell . He nosed his way from smell to smell ; the rough , the smooth , the dark , the golden . He went in and out , up and down , where they beat brass , where they bake bread , where the women sit combing their hair , where the bird-cages are piled high on the causeway , where the wine spills itself in dark red stains on the pavement , where leather smells and harness and garlic , where cloth is beaten , where vine leaves tremble , where men sit and drink and spit and dice - - he ran in and out , always with his nose to the ground , drinking in the essence ; or with his nose in the air vibrating with the aroma . He slept in this hot patch of sun - - how sun made the stone reek ! he sought that tunnel of shade - - how acid shade made the stone smell ! He devoured whole bunches of ripe grapes largely because of their purple smell ; he chewed and spat out whatever tough relic of goat or macaroni the Italian housewife had thrown from the balcony - - goat and macaroni were raucous smells , crimson smells . He followed the swooning sweetness of incense into the violet intricacies of dark cathedrals ; and , sniffing , tried to lap the gold on the window-stained tomb . Nor was his sense of touch much less acute . He knew Florence in its marmoreal smoothness and in its gritty and cobbled roughness . Hoary folds of drapery , smooth fingers and feet of stone received the lick of his tongue , the quiver of his shivering snout . Upon the infinitely sensitive pads of his feet he took the clear stamp of proud Latin inscriptions . In short , he knew Florence as no human being has ever known it ; as Ruskin never knew it or George Eliot either . He knew it as only the dumb know . Not a single one of his myriad sensations ever submitted itself to the deformity of words . But though it would be pleasant for the biographer to infer that Flush\\'s life in late middle age was an orgy of pleasure transcending all description ; to maintain that while the baby day by day picked up a new word and thus removed sensation a little further beyond reach , Flush was fated to remain for ever in a Paradise where essences exist in their utmost purity , and the naked soul of things presses on the naked nerve - - it would not be true . Flush lived in no such Paradise . The spirit , ranging from star to star , the bird whose furthest flight over polar snows or tropical forests never brings it within sight of human houses and their curling wood-smoke , may , for anything we know , enjoy such immunity , such integrity of bliss . But Flush had lain upon human knees and heard men\\'s voices . His flesh was veined with human passions ; he knew all grades of jealousy , anger and despair . Now in summer he was scourged by fleas . With a cruel irony the sun that ripened the grapes brought also the fleas . \" . . . Savonarola\\'s martyrdom here in Florence , \" wrote Mrs . Browning , \" is scarcely worse than Flush\\'s in the summer . \" Fleas leapt to life in every corner of the Florentine houses ; they skipped and hopped out of every cranny of the old stone ; out of every fold of old tapestry ; out of every cloak , hat and blanket . They nested in Flush\\'s fur . They bit their way into the thickest of his coat . He scratched and tore . His health suffered ; he became morose , thin and feverish . Miss Mitford was appealed to . What remedy was there , Mrs . Browning wrote anxiously , for fleas ? Miss Mitford , still sitting in her greenhouse at Three Mile Cross , still writing tragedies , put down her pen and looked up her old prescriptions - - what Mayflower had taken , what Rosebud . But the fleas of Reading die at a pinch . The fleas of Florence are red and virile . To them Miss Mitford\\'s powders might well have been snuff . In despair Mr . and Mrs . Browning went down on their knees beside a pail of water and did their best to exorcise the pest with soap and scrubbing-brush . It was in vain . At last one day Mr . Browning , taking Flush for a walk , noticed that people pointed ; he heard one man lay a finger to his nose and whisper \" La rogna \" ( mange ) . As by this time \" Robert is as fond of Flush as I am , \" to take his walk of an afternoon with a friend and to hear him thus stigmatised was intolerable . Robert , his wife wrote , \" wouldn\\'t bear it any longer . \" Only one remedy remained , but it was a remedy that was almost as drastic as the disease itself . However democratic Flush had become and careless of the signs of rank , he still remained what Philip Sidney had called him , a gentleman by birth . At end whereof is placed a costly portall : Resembling much the figure of a drumme , Granting slow entrance to a priuate closet : Where daily with a mallet in my hand , I set and frame all words and sounds that come , Vpon an Anuile and so make them fit : For the pere : vinckling poore ; that winding leades , From my close chamber to your Lordships cell .

Olfactus leades his company about the Stage , and goes out . Of Beasts living in the Water . Their Otters are most of them black , and their skins are almost as good as Bevers ; Their Oyl is of rare use for many things . Martins also have a good Fur for their bigness . Musquashes are almost like Beavers , but not so big , the Males stones smells as sweet as Musk , and being killed in Winter or the Spring they never loose their sweetness : they are no bigger than Cony-skins , and yet are sold for five shillings a piece . One good Skin will perfume a whole house full of Clothes . The Bevers wisdom and understanding makes him come nigh to a reasonable creature . His body is thick and short , with short leggs , feet like a Mole before , and behind like a Goose , a broad tail like a shoo-sole , very tough and strong : His head is something like an Otters , saving that his foreeteth be like Conies , two above and two beneath , sharp and broad , with which he cuts down Trees as big as a mans thigh , or bigger , which afterwards he divides into lengths according to the uses they are appoinetd for . If one Beaver be too weak to carry the Log , than another helps him : If two be too weak , three or four will assist , being placed three to three , which set their teeth in one anothers tough tails , and laying the load on the hindermost , they draw the Logg to the desired place , they tow it in the water , the youngest getting under it , bearing it up that it may swim the lighter . They build their houses of Wood and Clay , close by a Ponds side , and knowing their seasons , they build their houses answerably , three stories high , that when the Land Floods come they may shift higher , and when the waters fall , they remove lower . These houses are so strong that no Creature , save an industrious man with his penetrating tools can pierce them , their ingress and egress being under water . They make very good Ponds ; for knowing where a stream runs from between two rising Hills , they will pitch down Piles of Wood placing smaller Rubbish before it , with clay and sods , not leaving till by their Art and Industry they have made a firm and curious Dam-head , which may cause admiration in wise men . They keep themselves to their own Families , never parting so long as they are able to keep house together . Their wisdom secures them from the English , who seldom kill any of them , wanting time and patience to lay a long siege , or to be often deceived by their cunning evasions . So that all our Beavers come from the Indians , whose time and experience fits them for that imployment . Of the Birds , and Fowls both of Land and Water . They are expressed in these Verses . The princely Eagle , and the soaring Hawks , Within their unknown wayes ther \\' s none can chawk : The Hum-Bird for some Queens rich Cage more fit Than in the vacant wilderness to sit . The swift-wing \\' d Swallow sweeping to and fro , As swift as arrow from Tartarian bow . When as Aurora \\' s infant day new Springs , There th \\' morning mounting Lark her sweet layes sings . The harmonious Thrush , swift Pigeon , Turtle Dove Who to her Mate doth ever constant prove . The Turkey , Pheasant , Heathcock , Partridge rare , The Carrion-tearing Crow , and hurtful Stare ; The long-liv \\' d Raven , th \\' ominous Screach-Owl , Who tell ( as old wives say ) disasters foul . The drowsie Madge that leaves her day-lov \\' d nest To fly abroad when day-birds are at rest : The Eele murthering Hern , and greedy Cormorant , That neer the Creeks in Moorish Marshes haunt . The bellowing Bittern , with the long legg \\' d Crane . Presaging Winters hard , and dearth of Graine . These then are the natural signs by which we understand each other , and on this slender basis is built all human language . For without some natural signs , no artificial ones could have been invented or understood , as is very ingeniously observed by Dr . Reid . ( Inquiry into the Human Mind . ) VIII . The origin of this universal language is a subject of the highest curiosity , the knowledge of which has always been thought utterly inaccessible . A part of which we shall however here attempt . Light , sound , and odours , are unknown to the foetus in the womb , which , except the few sensations and motions already mentioned , sleeps away its time insensible of the busy world . But the moment he arrives into day , he begins to experience many vivid pains and pleasures ; these are at the same time attended with certain muscular motions , and from this their early , and individual association , they acquire habits of occurring together , that are afterwards indissoluble . 1 . Of Fear . As soon as the young animal is born , the first important sensations , that occur to him , are occasioned by the oppression about his precordia for want of respiration , and by his sudden transition from ninetyeight degrees of heat into so cold a climate . — He trembles , that is , he exerts alternately all the muscles of his body , to enfranchise himself from the oppression about his bosom , and begins to breathe with frequent and short respirations ; at the same time the cold contracts his red skin , gradually turning it pale ; the contents of the bladder and of the bowels are evacuated : and from the experience of these first disagreeable sensations the passion of fear is excited , which is no other than the expectation of disagreeable sensations . This early association of motions and sensations persists throughout life ; the passion of fear produces a cold and pale skin , with tremblings , quick respiration , and an evacuation of the bladder and bowels , and thus constitutes the natural or universal language of this passion . On observing a Canary bird this morning , January 28 , 1772 , at the house of Mr . Harvey , near Tutbury , in Derbyshire , I was told it always fainted away , when its cage was cleaned , and desired to see the experiment . The cage being taken from the ceiling , and its bottom drawn out , the bird began to tremble , and turned quite white about the root of his bill : he then opened his mouth as if for breath , and respired quick , stood straighter up on his perch , hung his wings , spread his tail , closed his eyes , and appeared quite stiff and cataleptic for near half an hour , and at length with much trembling and deep respirations came gradually to himself . 2 . Of Grief . That the internal membrane of the nostrils may be kept always moist , for the better perception of odours , there are two canals , that conduct the tears after they have done their office in moistening and cleaning the ball of the eye into a sack , which is called the lacrymal sack ; and from which there is a duct , that opens into the nostrils : the aperture of this duct is formed of exquisite sensibility , and when it is stimulated by odorous particles , or by the dryness or coldness of the air , the sack contracts itself , and pours more of its contained moisture on the organ of smell . By this contrivance the organ is rendered more fit for perceiving such odours , and is preserved from being injured by those that are more strong or corrosive . Many other receptacles of peculiar fluids disgorge their contents , when the ends of their ducts are stimulated ; as the gall bladder , when the contents of the duodenum stimulate the extremity of the common bile duct : and the salivary glands , when the termination of their ducts in the mouth are excited by the stimulus of the food we masticate . Atque vesiculae seminales suum exprimunt fluidum glande penis fricatâ . The coldness and dryness of the atmosphere , compared with the warmth and moisture , which the new-born infant had just before experienced , disagreeably affects the aperture of this lacrymal sack : the tears , that are contained in this sack , are poured into the nostrils , and a further supply is secreted by the lacrymal glands , and diffused upon the eye-balls ; as is very visible in the eyes and nostrils of children soon after their nativity . The same happens to us at our maturer age , for in severe frosty weather , snivelling and tears are produced by the coldness and dryness of the air . But the lacrymal glands , which separate the tears from the blood , are situated on the upper external part of the globes of each eye ; and , when a greater quantity of tears are wanted , we contract the forehead , and bring down the eye-brows , and use many other distortions of the face , to compress these glands . Now as the suffocating sensation , that produces respiration , is removed almost as soon as perceived , and does not recur again : this disagreeable irritation of the lacrymal ducts , as it must frequently recur , till the tender organ becomes used to variety of odours , is one of the first pains that is repeatedly attended to : and hence throughout our infancy , and in many people throughout their lives , all disagreeable sensations are attended with snivelling at the nose , a profusion of tears , and some peculiar distortions of countenance : according to the laws of early association before mentioned , which constitutes the natural or universal language of grief . You may assure yourself of the truth of this observation , if you will attend to what passes , when you read a distressful tale alone ; before the tears overflow your eyes , you will invariably feel a titillation at that extremity of the lacrymal duct , which terminates in the nostril , then the compression of the eyes succeeds , and the profusion of tears . Linnaeus asserts , that the female bear sheds tears in grief ; the same has been said of the hind , and some other animals . 3 . Of Tender Pleasure . The first most lively impression of pleasure , that the infant enjoys after its nativity , is excited by the odour of its mother \\' s milk . The organ of smell is irritated by this perfume , and the lacrymal sack empties itself into the nostrils , as before explained , and an increase of tears is poured into the eyes . Any one may observe this , when very young infants are about to suck ; for at those early periods of life , the sensation affects the organ of smell , much more powerfully , than after the repeated habits of smelling has inured it to odours of common strength : and in our adult years , the stronger smells , though they are at the same time agreeable to us , as of volatile spirits , continue to produce an increased secretion of tears . This pleasing sensation of smell is followed by the early affection of the infant to the mother that suckles it , and hence the tender feelings of gratitude and love , as well as of hopeless grief , are ever after joined with the titillation of the extremity of the lacrymal ducts , and a profusion of tears . Nor is it singular , that the lacrymal sack should be influenced by pleasing ideas , as the sight of agreeable food produces the same effect on the salivary glands . Ac dum vidimus insomniis lascivae puellae simulacrum tenditur penis . Lambs shake or wriggle their tails , at the time when they first suck , to get free of the hard excrement , which had been long lodged in their bowels . Hence this becomes afterwards a mark of pleasure in them , and in dogs , and other tailed animals . But cats gently extend and contract their paws when they are pleased , and purr by drawing in their breath , both which resemble their manner of sucking , and thus become their language of pleasure , for these animals having collar-bones use their paws like hands when they suck , which dogs and sheep do not . “ The Five Senses ” Seeinge From such a face whose Excellence May Captivate my Soveraignes sence And make him Phœbus like his throne Resigne to him younge Phaëton Whose skillesse and unsteaddie hand May prove the ruine of a land Unlesse great Jove downe from the skye Beholding Earthes Calamitie Strike with his hand that cannot err The proud Usurping Charioter And cure though Phœbus greive our woe From such a face that cann worke soe Wheresoere thou hast a beeing Blesse my Soveraigne , and his seeing . 2 .

Beat into a fine powder , and sift through a hair sieve , a pound of the Marc or Residuum left in the still after making Angelic Water then put it into a mortar , with a handful of fresh-gathered Rose Leaves , and a small porringer full of Gum Tragacanth softened with Rose Water , Beat the whole into a Paste ; roll it out on a dresser , with a rolling pin , and cut it into Lozenges with a knife . To form scented Pastils , roll up bits of this Paste in the shape of a cone , that they may stand upright , and set them by to dry . This kind of Pastils are lighted in the same manner as a candle . They consume entirely away ; and , while burning , exhale a fragrant smoke . 165 . A pleasant Perfume , Take a drachm of Musk , four Cloves , four ounces of Lavender-seed , a drachm and a half of Civet , and half a drachm of Ambergris ; heat your pestle and mortar , and rub the Musk , Cloves , and Lavender-seeds , together , with a lump of Loaf Sugar and a wine-glass full of Angelic or Rose-water . Take a handful of powder , and incorporate it well with this mixture , then sift it through a sieve ; add two or three pounds more powder , or even a larger quantity , till the perfume is brought to a proper degree of strength . As to the Civet , put it on the end of a hot pestle , and rub it well with a handful of powder ; after which add , by little and little , fix pounds of powder ; then sift the whole through a hair sieve to incorporate it with the other perfumed powder . The Ambergris must be well rubbed in the mortar ; and by degrees two pounds of powder , either white or grey , must : be added to it , till the Ambergris is thoroughly incorporated with the powder ; then sift through a hair sieve , and mix all the three powders together . This perfume is to be kept in a Leather Bag , the learns of which are well sewed with waxed thread . DRAINAGE . A nurse is not , in her avocation , consulted as to how to build a house-drain , and I see no reason therefore why she should be burdened with details of dry or wet removal of sewage , nor the course , material , and shape of drains ; these are the province of the architect and sanitary engineer . We may , however , state , enpassant on such subjects , that when her nose persistently , or even casually , suggests to her that there is an offensive smell in a certain room in the house in which she is nursing , she might think of a gas-jet not turned off , of leaking gas or soil-pipes , or an old forgotten cesspool , or leaking drain , and mention her suspicions to the doctor or to the responsible head of the house . But here , in my opinion , her duty and responsibility end so far as smells and drains are concerned . Her duties with regard to what I may term the drainage of the sick room include the disposal of : ( 1 ) Motions , urine , and clothes soiled with the same , from the sick room . ( 2 ) Refuse , bits and ends of food , from the same . ( 3 ) Utensils used in the same . ( 4 ) Dust collected in sweeping the sick room . II . Or Hot Bitters . A middle state of Vegetable Oyl , is observable in Turpentine Plants , as in Hypericon ; and their Smell and Taste will evince them to be pure Turpentine ; their Taste is Bitterish and Astringent , and their Smell Terebinthinate : in these the Acid fixes much on the Earthy Parts , and produces an Astringency ; whereby the Oyl is more loosned from it . It \\' s well known , that all Turpentine and Gums have a latent Acid , whence they are more easily distilled by additions of Absorbents ; and their true Vertues best Extracted by Tinctura Satis Tartari . The Vertues of Turpentine Plants depending on the Oyl , are Pectoral , Cleansing , and Diuretick ; and by their Astringent Faculty stopping ; but by both Vulnerary : for what better Vulnerary can there be , than that which is Cleansing , and Astringent , and smells Balsamick , as Turpentine Plants These Plants do bear the name of Balsamick , which are Terebinthinate and Aromatick ; as Botrys , Mecha-Balsam , Juniper , Ladanum segetum ; and these are more agreeable to the Stomach , than ordinary Turpentine ; and besides , their Vulnerary Faculty may be Cordial , they being also Aromatick . To these I must add another Class of Balsamicks , which having Turpentine in their Smell , give a Smell like dead Nettle ; so in red Lamium there is a Turpentine flavor , but another Smell is perceived also . In Panax coloni , and Sideritis , there is the same Dead-Nettle Smell ; and in Galeopsis both Smells are perceivable . A third degree of Balsamicks is in the Geranium Moschatum , and Geranium Columbinum , which taste Astringent , & smell of Musk ; and since other Geraniums smell of Turpentine , but these of Musk , I do suppose that the highest state of the Oyl Vegetable , is a rarefied Turpentine , which thereby becomes Odoriferous : Hence Terebinthinates taken inwardly , after a farther separation from their Acid , by the Salts of the Blood , cause a Violet Smell in the rine , because Aromaticks produce the same effects in the rine ; therefore Aromatick Odors , and Turpentine , are of an agreeable nature . Many Turpentine Balsams are of an Aromatick Smell , as Balsam de Tolu , Balsam Mechae , Balsam Peruvian , Benjamin , Storax ; and many Herbs , as Ladanum segetum , and Botrys , which have a Fragrant Terebinthinate Smell ; and so has Juniper , Cedar , and Sassafras ; besides Oyl of Turpentine will easily extract these Fragrant Oyls from Vegetables , and is frequently mixt with them by Sophistications ; whence I may argue , that they differ only as Turpentine is mixt with a latent Acid ; and as the other are more pure from Acid ; and therefore more Aethereal or Odoriferous : The Roots of Valerian smell like Turpentine , and the Flowers like Jessamy a little dryed . Strong Bitters , with a Fetid Odor , as Ballote ; these by their Bitterness correct Acids in the Stomach and Blood , and by their Fetidness amend the Acid in the Nervous Juyce , and cause an equal expansive motion of the Spirits , and prevent their unequal distribution into some Nerves , as in Fits of Convulsion . Strong Bitters , with a Pungency , or Acrid Bitters , as in Celandine ; these correct Acids , and open Obstructions also , by giving a quick motion to the Blood , which is done by their Volatile Bitter Oyl , and Volatile Pungent Salt , on which their Taste and Vertue depend . Strong Bitters Aromatick , as in Wormwood and Eupatorium Cannabinum , they work by their Volatile Oyl and Salt on the Blood , and Stomach ; whence they are accounted Antidotes against Coagulations , Venoms , and Pestilential Infections . Strong Bitters only , or pure Bitters , without any Aromatick or Fetid Odor , or Pungency ; such is the Bitterness in Bitter Almonds , and Centaury , their parts are more fixed than any of the other Strong Bitters : These cleanse the Stomach from Acid Phlegm ; open the Liver , by correcting the coagulating Acids in the Blood ; they mix with Acids , and pass by rine ; they preserve the Blood from coagulation , and help the office of the crude Bile in Hydropical Cachexies ; they have an Astriction by their Acid and Earthy Parts , which abounding in Bitters , help the Oyl in correcting Acids . The Principles of Bitters united by the Fire , produce fixt Salts , which correct Acids better than Bitters ; which also act as fixt Salts in all their effects . Elder-Bitters and Smells , as in Scorphularia ; these have a discussing Faculty outwardly , by their Fetidness and Bitterness . Nauseous Tastes , which are , 1 . Nauseous-Bitter , which depends on a composition of Mucilage and Bitter , as in Bryony-Roots , Squills , Berries of Spina Cervina , and Fox-Gloves ; the Mucilage in the Stomach relaxes the Fibres , and causes the Bitter to stick longer on them ; and so to act more strongly in Vomiting and Purging ; the same Taste is in Polygala and Sena . 2 . A Nauseous Taste depends on a sweet Bitter , mixed with Mucilage and Pungency , as in Aloes , Agarick , Rubarb : And Docks want only the Sweetness ; but have Bitter , Slimy , Sub-acrid Astringency . 3 . Too much Sweetness is Nauseous ; so is Manna , Honey , Polypody-Root ; a Sliminess or Gumminess is in Honey and Manna . 4 . Too much Bitter is Nauseous : Thus , in sweet Gall , the over-much Sweet or Bitter , over-impregnates the Papillae in the Mouth and Stomach , and cause an aversion in the Stomach ; as too much Light offends the Eyes , and makes them Water . 5 . An ill Smell gives a Nauseousness ; as in Aron Pouches , whose Smell will make any one vomit : And such have been the Smells of many Herbs which I bottled with warm Water , as Henbane and Spurge . In Tastes depending on a Volatile Oyl of Vegetables , ( with which is mixed a Pungent Volatile Salt ) this Oyly Salt produces either an Aromatick or Fetid Smell , and a pleasant Aromatick or Offensive Taste . The Taste is Aromatick , when the Sense is briskly affected , and a pleasing Agitation of Spirits produced . Aromaticks affect both the Smell and Taste gratefully ; they have a motion of Particles and Texture , agreeable to the Motion and Texture of Spirits : Spirits of Vegetables differ nothing from their Oyly Salts but by their being largely diffused in a Vehicle ; and an Oyly Salt is a Spirit contracted , and without a Vehicle . The effects of Aromaticks on the Body , are to warm the Stomach , and discuss Wind ; and these constitute the Class of the Sweet Aromaticks , or Fennil-Tastes : These are accounted Carminatives , because they rarefie the flatuous exhalations from the Chyle , in the primae viae , and so discuss them . These by their Sweetness allay the sharpness of Rheums , and lenifie their Acrimony : They are full of an Oyly Salt , by which they open the Passages of the Lungs and Kidneys : They extraordinarily discuss Tumors outwardly , by opening the Pores , and attenuating the matter included : The same Taste is spread through all the parts of the Plant , by the Oyly Salt : These Plants are umbelliferous . An Oyl may be distilled from these Plants , which has the Taste , Smell , and Vertue of these Plants : Whence I conclude , the Taste and Smell to proceed from the Oyl and Volatile Salt associated . The Second Class of Aromaticks , is the Bitterish Aromaticks , as Rosemary , Marjoram , Basil , Calamint , and Penny-Royal : By their Bitterness adjoyned to their Volatile Oyl and Salt , they correct Acids in the Stomach , cleanse the Lungs , and open Obstructions in the Glands , caused by coagulate Serum . The same effect is produced by the Saline Pungent Oyl , in altering the Acids in the Glands of the Brain , in correcting and attenuating its Lympha , and Succus Nervosus ; which , as all other Glandulous Humors , are prone to Stagnation , and Acidity : These Aromaticks by exciting their Motion , correcting Acidities , and thereby rendring the Succus Nervosus more Volatile , deserve the name of Cephalicks ; and it \\' s not improbable , that the Volatile parts dispose the Medicine to circulate towards the Brain , as Windy Liquors disturb the Head , and no other part . These Medicines evacuate Serum from the Blood , promote its circulation , and attenuate all the Humors of Chyle , Serum , Lympha , and Succus Nervosus ; these agree in Virtue with the Fennil Class , except that these work more by their Bitterness , as well as by the Pungent Oyl . The same Taste in these is spread through the whole Plant ; only the Bitterness depends on a fixt Oyl or Terebinth ; but the Aromatick on the Oyly Salt . Aromatick-Acrids , as Pepper , Ginger ; these have a very Acrid Volatile Salt and Oyl . All Aromaticks are Cordial , by rarefying the Blood by their Volatile Parts ; but the Acrid-Aromatick is the highest , having most Volatile Salt in it ; whereas the former have more Oyl than Salt . These Acrid-Aromaticks have either a Sweetness , or Bitterness ; and may be referred to the former Classes . Aromatick-Astringents : As Aromaticks , they are Cordial ; and from their Astringency , they strengthen the Fibres of the Stomach and Membranes , and all Nervous Parts ; and by an Acid evident in their Astringency , they hinder the greater Rarefaction of the Blood by their fragrant pungent Oyl . CHAP . VIII . Of Tastes joyned to Fetid Smells , making them contrary to Aromatick . WHEN the Oyl and Salt of Plants are in very great Proportion in any Plant , so as to emit violent Steams , offending the Organ of Smelling , but chiefly ( forcibly ) repelling the Spirits towards the Brain , ( which creates an Aversion to it ) a Fetid Smell is perceived . That a Fetor proceeds from Oyls , appears by the Smell of Rancid Oyl , and all distill \\' d Oyly Substances ; as Fat , Butter , and Oyl-Olive distill \\' d . That a Fetor , in the highest Degree , has also a Volatile Salt admixt , is proved by the Excrements of Animals , putrefied Flesh , rine , Blood , and putrefied Vegetables ; which yield a Volatile Salt . It does appear by divers Herbs bottled with Water for two Months , that a Fetor is produced ; from the Mucilaginous , as Mallow-Leaves ; from the Bitter , as Artichoak-Leaves ; from the Narcotick , an exceeding Fetidness , as Henbane-Leaves ; from the Excoriators , as Spurge : These smelling like the Excrements of Animals . Horse-radish smelt like Garlick ; Sorrel like Horse-dung . Putrefaction concurrs to produce these Fetors , by Separation of a Volatile Oyl and Salt , from the Acids and Earthy Parts of the Plants : So Spirit of Soot has an Oyly Salt ; and the Fetid Oyly Salt is easily separated from rine and Blood , after Putrefaction . Many Acrid Plants are Fetid ; so Sophia Chirurgorum , and the Pouches of Aron , are abominable . Cotula Faetida , Nettles , Garlick , and Onyons , have an Acrid Taste , and are very Fetid : . So is Galbanum , Assa Faetida , and Sagapenum . Divers Bitters are Fetid , as stinking Horehound ; and all Elder-Smells , as Scrophularia , are Bitter-Fetid : So the stinking Gums are Bitter , as well as Acrid and Fetid . The Mucilaginous are also Fetid , as in Atriplex olida . That there is but a Difference in degree betwixt Aromatick , and Fetid Plants , appears by many Instances ; as Galeopsis smells Fetid at first handling , afterwards Aromatick . The Flowers of Valerian are very strong , and offensive at first getting ; after a little drying , they are Aromatick : So in the Preparations of Musk and Civet , if in a great quantity , or while fresh , they stink ; afterwards , in a small quantity , they are more grateful : So the Leaves of Coriander stink ; but the Seed is Aromatick . Elder-Leaves are Fetid , yet the Flowers are very Fragrant ; so are the Flowers of Saponaria , though the Leaves resemble Elder . The Blossoms of most Trees are Fragrant , though the Leaves smell Crude . From the afore-mention \\' d Instances , Fetids are 1 . Bitter . 2 . Acrid . 3 . Mucilaginous , which are generally Narcoticks . From the afore-mention \\' d it may be inferr \\' d , that Fetids inwardly are of a very hot Nature , discussing Tumors outwardly , and opening the Pores . Inwardly , Fetids , by their Volatile Parts , do pierce the Channels of the Nerves , mend the Crudity of their Nervous Juyce ; and by their Faetor , they excite a different Motion from that in Hysterick Fits , and in Convulsions ; and do remove the Cause of that tumultuous Motion in the Spirits , by correcting Acidities , and Stagnation in the Succus Nervosus , which is disposed to them , as all other Glandulous Liquors be . Narcoticks have all of them an heavy offensive Smell , like Poppies , or Solanum ; or have a sweet heady Smell , like Roots of Bears-Ears . Milky-Narcoticks taste Mucilaginous , Bitter , and Acrid ; as Poppies , and Lettice : The Milky Juyce is an Argument of an Oyl , and the Acrid of a Volatile Salt adjoyned . Opium is a Bitter-Acrid , has a Resin , and Gum inflammable : Though it \\' s easily extracted by the Spirit of Wine , yet the Bitterness and Acrid , in which its Vertue is founded , is most corrected by Spirit of Vinegar , Juyce of Lemons , Juyce of Quinces , or any other Acid , as well as by drying it , and evaporating some Part of the Narcotick Fume . The Second Class may be of Bitterish , Sub-acrid , Mucilaginous Narcoticks ; as Solanum Lethale , Bacciferum , Stramonium , Cynoglossum : Besides the Pungency , Solanum Lignosum has a Bitterness : The Roots of Cynogloss boyl \\' d , smell like Spirit of Harts-Horn . Fresh Tabaco smells Narcotick about the Flowers , and is Bitter , Mucilaginous , and Acrid : It much resembles Henbane by its Figure , Oyl and Clamminess to the Touch ; but by its Bitterness and Pungency , Solanum Lignosum . The Third Class of Opiates , is Sweetish , Acrid , and Fetid , differing from Poppy smell , as Cicutaria , Napellus . The Roots of Henbane are very sweet . These produce Giddiness , with a stupor ; and their best Antidote are Acids , as Vinegar . The Fourth Class has a Bitterish Acrid Taste , as Cowslips ; and these have also a Fragrancy very heady , being of a low degree amongst Opiates : The Roots of Cowslips are very Acrid and Bitterish . By the afore-mentioned Instances it appears , that Opiates have very hot Effluviums , which offend the Smell . By the same , Opiates inwardly produce Sweat in so small a quantity as one or two grains ; and are very Fetid by their Oyly Acrid Salt , which runs through all the Classes of Opiates . The Bitterness and Sweetness in some Opiates , no way conduce to encrease their Soporifick quality , but are different in many Opiates . Narcoticks taken inwardly , immediately affect the Nerves in the Stomach , and produce an heaviness there ; which I have been sensible of , in tasting the Solanum , and Poppies ; and they cannot pass a Digestion and Separation , nor by a circulation arrive at the Brain , so soon as their effects are produced therein : Therefore Narcotick Fumes must pass through the Pores of the Nerves , and begin to fix the Spirits in the Membranes and Nerves of the Stomach ; by which a stupor is communicated to the rest . Something of the Opiates passes a Digestion , and afterwards a Circulation through the Blood ; where it makes no alteration by its Narcotick quality ; but being Bitter and Acrid , it produces a Diaphoresis , as others of that Taste do . In the Nerves these Narcotick Fumes weaken the brisk expansion of the Spirits , ( which causes waking ) and their too great Agitation , ( which causes pain ) and likewise stops their Tumultuous motion in Convulsions , and the violent motion of the Heart and Pulse , as well as any Flux of Humors whatsoever , by abating the violent contractions of the irritated Fibres . Humors that are Acid are corrected by the Acrid Taste and Bitterness ; but Choler can no other ways be helped , but by abating the Acid combined with it , and making it corrosive , as well as by stopping the motion , and evacuation of it . From the Symptoms allayed by Narcoticks , I argue , That they work not as Oyls and Volatile Salts , though they have them ; for they rather produce an expansion , agitation , and tumult in the Spirits : And I also conjecture , that the Narcotick Faculty is best deducible from such a combination of the Volatile Oyl and Salt , with a Mucilage , as to gain thereby a particular Figure , Motion , or Texture ; by reason of which , it weakens the motion of the Spirits , and in too great a quantity destroys their fluidity . Burnt Alum mixt with Gun-Powder , destroys its Elastick force , and weakens the burst of a Gun . Water loses its fluidity by the small Particles of Cold : And Mercury is made Solid , by the Fumes of Lead . Nothing can be more easily fixt , by divers additions of other things , though in it self it has a greater Agitation of parts than other fluids , which being stopt in their internal motion , become Solids ; and if Opiates do weaken or deprive the Nervous Juyce of its Internal Agitation , from thence all their Phaenomena may be explain \\' d . All Narcoticks have offensive Smells , by which we are taught by Nature to avoid them ; and this Antipathy can proceed from nothing , but the disagreeable Texture and Motion of the Narcotick Fumes to our Spirits : Opiates cause not Sleep , unless in great quantity , in Consumptive Bodies ; for in them , a little quantity troubles the Head , and disturbs the Spirits with Giddiness , because their Spirits are very hot and fiery , and their motion , for want of a serose Vehicle , very violent ; but it seems not probable , as some conjecture , that one grain of Opium should force so much Serum to flow to the glandules of the Brain , as to fill them , and produce Sleep , by too much diluting the Spirits : Whereas we frequently drink a full Gallon of Water , or other Liquors , which supply a greater quantity of Serum , without causing Sleep . Opiates by their sharp Acrid Salt stimulate , as Venereals ; and by their Bitter Sliminess and Acrimony , they purge . A slimy Mucilage attends Opiates , which outwardly has a good effect to temper Heat in Inflammations ; whilst the Effluviums that are Narcotick , abate the Agitation of Spirits . By their Mucilage ; Opiates may repel , and also inwardly given , by the same they allay sharpness of Coughs , and corrosive Salts ; whilst their Narcotick Fumes fix the motion of Humors , by robbing the Spirits of their Activity ; by their Bitter-Acrid they discuss ; and by their Mucilages mollifie Tumors ; as inwardly , their Bitter-Acrid corrects the Acid ; the Mucilage tempers the Choler ; and for this end the Poppy-Syrups and Waters , are the best ; having more Mucilage than Acrid or Bitter . But Opium more Bitter and Acrid , than Mucilage ; wherefore it is more convenient in Acid Humors . CHAP . IX . Of Volatile Salts , and the Tastes and Vertues depending on them . IN many Plants , there is a Volatile Salt , discernable by the Acrid Pungency , produced on the Tongue ; as in Aron-Roots . That this Pungency is a Volatile Salt , though it has no Saltish Taste , appears by the following Experiment . I distilled some Mustard-seed in a Retort , which afforded both Oyl and Spirit ; which being rectified , turned Syrup of Violets green ; though this Salt , in its natural state , will not so readily turn Syrup of Violets , as Animal Salts do . The Infusion of Aron-Roots in Water , did a little green the Syrup of Violets , after some time . Spirit of Scurvy-Grass , or Aqua Raphani composita , would not turn Syrup of Violets ; nor Horse-Radish-Roots , infused in Water ; tho \\' the leaves bottled with Water , turned the Syrup after some time . Juyce of Aron-Roots would not turn it ; the Leek-Roots sliced into Water , mixt with Syrup of Violets , turned it after a long time . The mixture of other Principles with the Salt , hinder its greenning of the Syrup of Violets : So a Decoction of Harts-Horn for the same reason , will not do what the Spirit does in turning the Colour . It \\' s well known that Vinegar , and other Acids , as Lemmon , Citron , Sorrel , do best correct the Pungent Acrimony of the Vegetable Salts ; and therefore Vinegar is used in Sallets ; Oyl is used for the securing of the Stomach from their corrosive Acrimony : Yet the Acrid Salt of Vegetables will not ferment with Acids , as the Animal Salts do . Juyce of Aron-Roots , and Spirit of Scurvy-Grass , will not ferment with Oyl of Vitriol . These different Classes , I have observed in the Volatile Salts of Plants . The Watry-Acrid having a pungent Smell , like Mustard or Scurvy-Grass , and the Cresses : These have a tolerable Pungency , and but a little Oyl with their pungent Salt . The Vertue of these Cress-tasted Plants , is first from their Salts , which excite Appetite , and volatilize the Acid Ferment in the Stomach , and therefore are Stomachicks : In the Blood they amend the coagulating Acids , open Obstructions in the Spleen and Brain , and all the Glandules ; and therefore are Antiscorbutick , Splenetick , Diuretick , and Sudorifick ; outwardly they discuss , and have the Virtues of Volatile Salts , in Pains , and Scald-Heads , and Scorbutick Spots . By the Watry crude Parts adjoyned , they temper their own Acrimony , and make it more agreeable to hot Bloods ; as in Brooklime . I distilled Colewort-Roots , which tasted like Horse-Radish ; and had an Acid mixt with Pungency , which would not turn Syrup of Violets ; this distillation was in Sand , in a glass Retort . There are many degrees of Pungency in this Class ; so that choice may be made for particular Constitutions . There is a Bitterness in many of this Class , which helps the Operation of the Acrid : if the Acrid prevails , they belong to this Class ; if the Bitter , they are referrible to the Bitters with Acrimony . The second Class of Volatile Salts , is in rank Tastes , and smells like Garlick and Onyons , whose Smells are rank Fetid , and their Tastes very pungent Hot . From Horse-Radish Leaves , bottled up with Water two Months ; and from their smelling like Garlick , as well as from their pungent Taste , and quick flying up the Nose and Eyes , like Sal-Ammoniack , I conclude , that the Cepaceous kind , would very properly constitute a second degree of Volatile Salts , and a much stronger than the former . They correct Acids , and Phlegm in the Stomach ; and excite Appetite by their Pungency : they attenuate the Phlegm in the Lungs , and open Obstructions there , by their Volatile Salt ; and therefore are good Pectorals and Stomachicks : They alter the Blood , as Volatile Salts ; and are good against Infection , and the Scurvy ; and as Diureticks , by their Salts they are good for the Dropsie : outwardly they discuss more than the former Class ; and their Mucilaginous Roots are emollient , and ripen Apostumes ; and by their Salt they draw forcibly , and discuss and attenuate . Thlaspi tastes like Horse-Radish , and smells like Garlick . The third , and highest degree of Vegetable Acrid-Salt , is in the Exulcerators , Vesicatories , or Corrosive Tastes : These have an Acrimony that destroys the Organ of Tasting ; as among Animals a fierce Volatile Salt is in Cantharides , which is Vesicatory : And strong Spirit of Sal-Ammoniack blisters the Tongue . So in the first Class of Exulcerators , there is a very Acrid Taste , and quick pungent Scent , depending on the Salt only ; the Plant being Watry , having no strong Oyly Smell : and these may be called Watry Exulcerators ; as the Ranunculus , Anemone , Aron , Dragons , Ranunculus flammeus : Vesicatories pierce the Pores , and by their pungent Acrimony irritate the Glandules in the Cutis , to send forth their Serum , and separate the Cuticula into a Blister . The Corrosives have a higher degree of Acrimony ; they pierce the Cuticula and Cutis , with Pain ; they alter and tear their Pores , drive out their Serum , and thereby induce an lcer , and corrosion of the Cutis . Note , That the first Class is Vesicatory , or Corrosive Watry . The second Class is where the Volatile Salt is mixt with a hot fiery Oyl ; as in Euphorbium , Ivy-Gum ; and these Plants have a strong Smell , with an Acrid Taste . The Milky or Resinous Exulcerators , have an Oyl more fixt , joyned to an Acid-Acrid Salt ; as Tithymalus , and Esula ; and these smell Acid , rather than of any hot Scent . Mezereon , and Laureola , have a faint Lily-Smell ; in these the Oyl is not much conducing to any Corrosiveness : But that depends on the Volatile Salt alone , made more Volatile by addition of some Oyl . Isop is reasonable long lasting : young roots are good set , slips better . A good pot-hearbe . Iuly-flowers , commonly called Gilly-flowers , or Cloue-Iuly-flowers ( I call them so , because they flowre in Iuly ) they haue the name of Cloues , of their sent . I may well call them the King of flowers ( except the Rose ) and the best sort of them are called Queene-Iuly flowers . I haue of them nine or ten seuerall colours , and diuers of them as big as Roses : of all flowers ( saue the Damaske Rose ) they are the most pleasant to sight and smell : they last not past three or foure yeeres vnremoued . Take the sl • ps ( without shanks ) aud set any time , saue in extreme frost , but especially at Michael tide . Their vse is much in ornament , and conforting the spirits , by the sence of smelling . Iuly flowers of the wall , or wall-Iuly-flowers wall-flowers , or Bee-flowers , or Winter-Iuly-flowers , because growing in the walles , euen in Winter , and good for Bees , will grow euen in stone walls , they will seeme dead in Summer , and yet reuiue in Winter . They yeeld seed plentifully , which you may sow at any time , or in any broken earth , especially on the top of a mud-wall , but moist , you may set the root before it be brancht , euery slip that is not flowr \\' d will take root , or crop him in Summer , and he will flower in Winter : but his Winter-seed is vntimely . This and Palmes are exceeding good , and timely for Bees . Leekes yeeld seed the second yeere , vnremoued and die , vnlesse you remoue them , vsuall to eate with salt and bread , as Onyons alwaies greene , good pot-hearb , euill for the eyes . Lauendar Spike would be remoued within 7 yeeres , or eight at the most . Slips twined as Isop and Sage , would take best at Michael-tide . This flower is good for Bees , most comfortable for smelling , except Roses : and kept dry , is as strong after a yeere , and when it is gathered . The water of this is comfortable . White Lauendar would be remoued sooner . Lettice yeelds seed the first yeere , and dyes : sow betime , and if you would haue them Cabbage for Sallets , remoue them as you doe Cabbage . They are vsuall in Sallets , and the pot . Lillies white and red , remoued once in three or foure yeeres their roots yeeld many Sets , like the Garlicke , Michael-tide is the best : they grow high , after they get roote : these roots are good to breake a Byle , as are Mallowes and Sorrell . \" I han got no money , I tell ye , \" said Barton . Wilson looked disappointed . Barton tried not to be interested , but he could not help it in spite of his gruffness . He rose , and went to the cupboard ( his wife \\' s pride long ago ) . There lay the remains of his dinner , hastily put by ready for supper . Bread , and a slice of cold fat boiled bacon . He wrapped them in his handkerchief , put them in the crown of his hat , and said — \" Come , let \\' s be going . \" \" Going—art thou going to work this time o \\' day ? \" \" No , stupid , to be sure not . Going to see the fellow thou spoke on . \" So they put on their hats and set out . On the way Wilson said Davenport was a good fellow , though too much of the Methodee ; that his children were too young to work , but not too young to be cold and hungry ; that they had sunk lower and lower , and pawned thing after thing , and that now they lived in a cellar in Berry Street , off Store Street . Barton growled inarticulate words of no benevolent import to a large class of mankind , and so they went along till they arrived in Berry Street . It was unpaved ; and down the middle a gutter forced its way , every now and then forming pools in the holes with which the street abounded . Never was the Old Edinburgh cry of \" Gardez l \\' eau \" more necessary than in this street . As they passed , women from their doors tossed household slops of every description into the gutter ; they ran into the next pool , which overflowed and stagnated . Heaps of ashes were the stepping-stones , on which the passer-by , who cared in the least for cleanliness , took care not to put his foot . Our friends were not dainty , but even they picked their way till they got to some steps leading down into a small area , where a person standing would have his head about one foot below the level of the street , and might at the same time , without the least motion of his body , touch the window of the cellar and the damp muddy wall right opposite . You went down one step even from the foul area into the cellar in which a family of human beings lived . It was very dark inside . The window-panes were , many of them , broken and stuffed with rags , which was reason enough for the dusky light that pervaded the place even at mid-day . After the account I have given of the state of the street , no one can be surprised that on going into the cellar inhabited by Davenport , the smell was so fœtid as almost to knock the two men down . Quickly recovering themselves , as those inured to such things do , they began to penetrate the thick darkness of the place , and to see three or four little children rolling on the damp , nay wet , brick floor , through which the stagnant , filthy moisture of the street oozed up ; the fire-place was empty and black ; the wife sat on her husband \\' s lair , and cried in the dank loneliness . \" See , missis , I \\' m back again . — Hold your noise , children , and don \\' t mither [ 13 ] your mammy for bread ; here \\' s a chap as has got some for you . \" In that dim light , which was darkness to strangers , they clustered round Barton , and tore from him the food he had brought with him . It was a large hunch of bread , but it vanished in an instant . \" We mun do summut for \\' em , \" said he to Wilson . \" Yo stop here , and I \\' ll be back in half-an-hour . \" So he strode , and ran , and hurried home . He emptied into the ever-useful pocket-handkerchief the little meal remaining in the mug . Mary would have her tea at Miss Simmonds \\' ; her food for the day was safe . Then he went up-stairs for his better coat , and his one , gay , red-and-yellow silk pocket-handkerchief—his jewels , his plate , his valuables , these were . He went to the pawn-shop ; he pawned them for five shillings ; he stopped not , nor stayed , till he was once more in London Road , within five minutes \\' walk of Berry Street—then he loitered in his gait , in order to discover the shops he wanted . He bought meat , and a loaf of bread , candles , chips , and from a little retail yard he purchased a couple of hundredweights of coals . Some money yet remained—all destined for them , but he did not yet know how best to spend it . Food , light , and warmth , he had instantly seen were necessary ; for luxuries he would wait . Wilson \\' s eyes filled with tears when he saw Barton enter with his purchases . He understood it all , and longed to be once more in work , that he might help in some of these material ways , without feeling that he was using his son \\' s money . But though \" silver and gold he had none , \" he gave heart-service and love works of far more value . Nor was John Barton behind in these . \" The fever \" was ( as it usually is in Manchester ) of a low , putrid , typhoid kind ; brought on by miserable living , filthy neighbourhood , and great depression of mind and body . It is virulent , malignant , and highly infectious . But the poor are fatalists with regard to infection ; and well for them it is so , for in their crowded dwellings no invalid can be isolated . Wilson asked Barton if he thought he should catch it , and was laughed at for his idea . The two men , rough , tender nurses as they were , lighted the fire , which smoked and puffed into the room as if it did not know the way up the damp , unused chimney . The very smoke seemed purifying and healthy in the thick clammy air . The children clamoured again for bread ; but this time Barton took a piece first to the poor , helpless , hopeless woman , who still sat by the side of her husband , listening to his anxious miserable mutterings . She took the bread , when it was put into her hand , and broke a bit , but could not eat . She was past hunger . She fell down on the floor with a heavy unresisting bang . The men looked puzzled . \" She \\' s well-nigh clemmed , \" said Barton . \" Folk do say one mustn \\' t give clemmed people much to eat ; but , bless us , she \\' ll eat nought . \" \" I \\' ll tell yo what I \\' ll do , \" said Wilson . \" I \\' ll take these two big lads , as does nought but fight , home to my missis \\' s for to-night , and I \\' ll get a jug o \\' tea . Them women always does best with tea and such-like slop . \" So Barton was now left alone with a little child , crying ( when it had done eating ) for mammy ; with a fainting , dead-like woman ; and with the sick man , whose mutterings were rising up to screams and shrieks of agonised anxiety . He carried the woman to the fire , and chafed her hands . He looked around for something to raise her head . There was literally nothing but some loose bricks . However , those he got ; and taking off his coat he covered them with it as well as he could . He pulled her feet to the fire , which now began to emit some faint heat . He looked round for water , but the poor woman had been too weak to drag herself out to the distant pump , and water there was none . He snatched the child , and ran up the area-steps to the room above , and borrowed their only saucepan with some water in it . Then he began , with the useful skill of a working-man , to make some gruel ; and when it was hastily made he seized a battered iron table-spoon ( kept when many other little things had been sold in a lot ) , in order to feed baby , and with it he forced one or two drops between her clenched teeth . The mouth opened mechanically to receive more , and gradually she revived . She sat up and looked round ; and recollecting all , fell down again in weak and passive despair . Her little child crawled to her , and wiped with its fingers the thick-coming tears which she now had strength to weep . It was now high time to attend to the man . He lay on straw , so damp and mouldy no dog would have chosen it in preference to flags ; over it was a piece of sacking , coming next to his worn skeleton of a body ; above him was mustered every article of clothing that could be spared by mother or children this bitter weather ; and in addition to his own , these might have given as much warmth as one blanket , could they have been kept on him ; but as he restlessly tossed to and fro , they fell off and left him shivering in spite of the burning heat of his skin . Every now and then he started up in his naked madness , looking like the prophet of woe in the fearful plague-picture ; but he soon fell again in exhaustion , and Barton found he must be closely watched , lest in these falls he should injure himself against the hard brick floor . He was thankful when Wilson re-appeared , carrying in both hands a jug of steaming tea , intended for the poor wife ; but when the delirious husband saw drink , he snatched at it with animal instinct , with a selfishness he had never shown in health . Then the two men consulted together . It seemed decided , without a word being spoken on the subject , that both should spend the night with the forlorn couple ; that was settled . But could no doctor be had ? In all probability , no ; the next day an infirmary order might be begged , but meanwhile the only medical advice they could have must be from a druggist \\' s . So Barton ( being the moneyed man ) set out to find a shop in London Road . It is a pretty sight to walk through a street with lighted shops ; the gas is so brilliant , the display of goods so much more vividly shown than by day , and of all shops a druggist \\' s looks the most like the tales of our childhood , from Aladdin \\' s garden of enchanted fruits to the charming Rosamond with her purple jar . No such associations had Barton ; yet he felt the contrast between the well-filled , well-lighted shops and the dim gloomy cellar , and it made him moody that such contrasts should exist . They are the mysterious problem of life to more than him . He wondered if any in all the hurrying crowd had come from such a house of mourning . He thought they all looked joyous , and he was angry with them . But he could not , you cannot , read the lot of those who daily pass you by in the street . How do you know the wild romances of their lives ; the trials , the temptations they are even now enduring , resisting , sinking under ? You may be elbowed one instant by the girl desperate in her abandonment , laughing in mad merriment with her outward gesture , while her soul is longing for the rest of the dead , and bringing itself to think of the cold-flowing river as the only mercy of God remaining to her here . You may pass the criminal , meditating crimes at which you will to-morrow shudder with horror as you read them . You may push against one , humble and unnoticed , the last upon earth , who in Heaven will for ever be in the immediate light of God \\' s countenance . Errands of mercy—errands of sin—did you ever think where all the thousands of people you daily meet are bound ? Barton \\' s was an errand of mercy ; but the thoughts of his heart were touched by sin , by bitter hatred of the happy , whom he , for the time , confounded with the selfish . He reached a druggist \\' s shop , and entered . The druggist ( whose smooth manners seemed to have been salved over with his own spermaceti ) listened attentively to Barton \\' s description of Davenport \\' s illness ; concluded it was typhus fever , very prevalent in that neighbourhood ; and proceeded to make up a bottle of medicine , sweet spirits of nitre , or some such innocent potion , very good for slight colds , but utterly powerless to stop , for an instant , the raging fever of the poor man it was intended to relieve . He recommended the same course they had previously determined to adopt , applying the next morning for an infirmary order ; and Barton left the shop with comfortable faith in the physic given him ; for men of his class , if they believe in physic at all , believe that every description is equally efficacious . Meanwhile , Wilson had done what he could at Davenport \\' s home . He had soothed , and covered the man many a time ; he had fed and hushed the little child , and spoken tenderly to the woman , who lay still in her weakness and her weariness . He had opened a door , but only for an instant ; it led into a back cellar , with a grating instead of a window , down which dropped the moisture from pigsties , and worse abominations . It was not paved ; the floor was one mass of bad smelling mud . It had never been used , for there was not an article of furniture in it ; nor could a human being , much less a pig , have lived there many days . Yet the \" back apartment \" made a difference in the rent . The Davenports paid threepence more for having two rooms . When he turned round again , he saw the woman suckling the child from her dry , withered breast . \" Surely the lad is weaned ! \" exclaimed he , in surprise . \" Why , how old is he ? \" OLEUM AMYGDALJE .

By taking their experience as a rule for our own government , we shall at once get rid of all scientific doubts and disputes ; learn how to anticipate what may happen to ourselves , should the project of our opponents succeed \\' ; and be able to determine how far it is right and wise in us to make some temporary sacrifice , in order to avert a great and permanent evil . Those who recollect and compare the opinions and the promises held forth by the Company , in their Prospectus for an Oil-gas Establishment in 1823 , will , we think , place little reliance on the promises now made in their project for a Coal-gas work , just circulated amongst us , in 1828 . They have deceived and broken faith with us once : it is our own fault if we suffer ourselves to be so gulled and benoodled again ; and when they tell us that “ nothing can be farther from the wish and intention of the company than to injure us by their operations , ” we now , from bitter experience , tell them , that the only security on which we can rely for safety is not to let them get the power to annoy us . We shall first exhibit the substance of the evidence given before the Committee of the House of Commons , by persons residing in the vicinity of the Peter-Street Gas-work in Westminster , because this was held forth as a sort of pattern work , where all the new improvements have been successfully introduced , and are in full operation ; and where , in consequence , we may expect to hear that no smoke is perceived , no smells emitted , no effluvia let loose , to taint and vitiate the air . We may add , that the leading Counsel of our opponents is the governor of this great establishment , a person not only learned in the law , but intimately acquainted with all the machinery of the work , and all the details of its operations . Under his government , every improvement , we may presume , would be adopted to abate nuisance , every precaution used to diminish its amount : yet nuisance still exists ; and although the Deputy-Chairman of the Oilgas Company was pleased , in his late speech , sneeringly to deseant on what he termed pretended nuisance , yet , trifling as he may affect to consider it , we much doubt , with all his zeal for the public good , whether he would not rather see a Coal-gas work set down at any other man \\' s door than his own . Mr A . D . STEWART , army agent , has lived in Grosvenor Terrace for three years ; his house is opposite the east end of the gas-work , and distant from it about 100 yards . He is much annoyed by smell and smoke , proceeding both from the chimney and from parts of the work below the chimney : the smoke is equal to that from a brewery or distillery , and is often connected with a very offensive smell : when the wind sets toward his house , the effluvia produce sickness : his wife equally complains of it : — Says , that the smell is still worse in Marsham Street , through which he often passes ; that he has felt it in Abingdon Street , from 200 to 300 yards distant , more even than in his own house , because his own house , being more under the chimney , the smoke does not fall so immediately about it as at a greater distance : — Says farther , that the present lease of his house was for three years , and expires in June , when he will avail himself of the expiration of the term to leave it , “ as I consider , ” he adds , \" the health of my family to have been materially affected whilst I resided there . ” Examined by the Committee as to the nature of the smell , he says it was a very strong smell , extremely offensive , and often producing nausea and sickness : That it “ was not the smell of gas , but seemed to him to arise from the evaporation of the lime-water under the flue * , being different from what arose from the escape of gas in the streets , where a pipe is damaged , or from the smell of a common sewer . Mr GEORGE PEARCE , surgeon , has lived at 46 . Marsham Street upwards of twenty years . His house is so near the gas-work , that the garden-wall is separated from that of the work only by a narrow passage : Has very often complained of the smoke from the gas-works , which issues from the whole building , as well as from the chimney , and smut often falls from the smoke as it passes over his house : Says that he once joined with others to get rid of the nuisance by legal means , but one of the chief parties in the process at the time ( witness \\' s partner Mr JOHNSON ) sold his property to the Gas Establishment , and the others did not then proceed : would be extremely glad again to join in it , to get rid of the nuisance . Says that a great many of the more respectable people who were living in the street when the works were first established , have left it , and those who now occupy it are not able to contend with this wealthy body ; that he has considerable practice in the neighbourhood , and opportunity of collecting the sentiments of his neighbours , and has heard every individual complain whom he has heard speak on the subject ; that , in his own little garden , plants do not now thrive as they did before the gas-work was established ; partly , as he thinks , from the smoke , and partly from their more confined situation by the lofty walls of thwe work . He adds , that the paint on the window frames of his house is changed in colour . Mr THOMAS COBLER has lived forty-seven years in Marsham Street , being proprietor of eight houses there : states that the rent of his houses has fallen since the gaswork was established , and he is sure it is owing to that work : That he suffers great personal inconvenience from the gas-work , from the smoke , the smell , and the blacks , which frequently prevent the drying of linen in his garden : That a great deal of smoke proceeds from the chimney ; and when they draw their coke from the retorts , a great deal of smoke comes then : That his little garden is ruined , nothing will grow now in it , though things grew there before : That he continues to live in the street , although it is very disagreeable , because his property all lies around him , which is the reason that induces him to continue there . Mr John GASSON , clerk in the Sun Fire Office , has resided in Marsham Street twenty-three years : remembers the first establishment of the gas-works , then comparatively small : Says that very soon after their establishment an interdict was preferred against them , and they were stopped : That a Mr Johnson got the neighbours to join in preferring a bill , but that he afterwards compromised with the gas company , by selling them all the premises he occupied , which were extensive , containing pretty houses and good gardens , for which he got £25,000 ; after this , the indictment was not proceeded in : Says that his own house is about thirty or forty yards from the small chimney , and twenty or thirty more from the large one : That he has experienced great inconvenience from the neighbourhood of the gas-works , and that , up to the present time , he sees no difference : That , at times , the chimney smokes very much , very like a brewery or distillery : That the smoke enters his house , and , when the wind is west and south-west , the blacks fall in his garden like hail : That the smells from the works are very bad , and often , when their doors and windows are opened , they are glad to get them shut again , as quick as they can : That the smell is not always the same , and is worse at one time than another : That , at night , it is sometimes intolerable , even in streets , as College Street , Smith Street , and Dean Street , at a considerable distance from his residence , between 200 or 300 yards : That most of this smell at night is when they are pumping the ammoniacal liquor into vessels , and carrying it away in carts * ; it is then hardly possible to bear the place : That the smell from the carts is very considerable , and if , when in the street , he knew the way the carts were coming , he would certainly take a circuitous route rather than meet them : That the paint of his house externally is very much affected , and where the air finds its way in at apertures , it changes the colour , as if it were rubbed over with a black-lead brush , which he attributes to the gas-works , as it was not so before they were established : That articles of brass or copper are soon again discoloured after they are cleaned : That he has always considered the gas-works to be a nuisance , and that every one of his neighbours he has conversed with is of the same opinion : That his wife complains of the works as affecting her health , and when they ( the works ) are very bad , she is obliged to go out . Examined by the Committee : - Says that the smells depend much on the wind : That the value of property is diminishing since the establishment of the gas-work : That persons who have not resided there a considerable time would not be anxious to come there , and those who remain , approved it much more before the works were there : That they have smoke and smells now , which they had not before : That when they draw their retorts , the smoke comes in a great body through the tiles , and this smoke yields a very disagreeable smell , like that of water thrown upon fire . Mr EDWARD TENNANT , currier , lives at 47 . Marsham Street : has lived there nine years : is so near the gas-work that the bottom of his garden is only about six feet and a half from the high wall : Says he is much inconvenienced by the great smoke and nasty smells from the gas-works : That his wife complains very much of them : That the smell is greater at one time than another , and is felt most when they are drawing the retorts : That from the top of his house he can command a view of the whole works , and from thence he has seen immense quantities of smoke issue from the retort-house : That his wife complains that her sight is affected by the works : - Says that the street is inhabited chiefly by tradesmen , and that there is great difficulty in letting lodgings in it ; he himself had a first floor to let , and when any one came to look at his rooms , they would ask , “ What building is that at the back ? ” he told them the gas-works : they instantly replied , “ Then I cannot come and live near them . ” Mr JAMES MARR , 25 . Kensington Place , lived formerly in No . 58 . Marsham Street for two years and a half ; removed from it on account of his wife \\' s illness ; attributes that illness to the gas-works : That her surgeon , who attended her for a year and a half , advised her to remove on account of said works : That his present residence is about 200 yards from the works , since which his wife \\' s health has mended ; but he will move still farther as soon as possible : That he has perceived 3 both smoke and smells from the gas-works : That the smells are very disagreeable : That when the wind was in a particular quarter , they could not keep either door or windows open : That he is in the employ of the East India Company , and absent from home every day except Sundays , but feels the nuisance in the morning and evenings when going from or returning home : That , in dull weather the smell is worse , from being longer retained in the atmosphere , and falling down ; and that he still feels it in his present residence , though not so objectionable . Mr W . ANNISON , No . 52 , Marsham Street , has lived there seven or eight years . The back front of his house is about 45 feet from the gas-works , 100 feet from the small chimney , and 50 more from the large one : That he constantly feels nuisance from the gas-work , in respect of the smell ; but it is not a smell , it is a stink : That there is plenty of smoke from both the chimneys : That he had a garden , and a fine pear-tree in it , but that not a pear is to be seen upon it since it was surrounded with these gas-works : That his wife complains of the smell ; and that linen , hung to dry in the garden , is often obliged to be washed over again , in consequence of the smoke falling on it : That the paint on his house is discoloured by the gas-works : That he continues to reside in Marsham Street only on account of his business , or he would not stop there another day : That he has felt the smell in Millbank Street , a distance of 400 yards in a straight line from the works : That the brass utensils in his house are constantly discoloured by the gas works , and that his neighbours generally complain of them . WILLIAM BENTHAM , emery manufacturer , has lived twenty-eight years in Marsham Street ; is quite near to the gas-works ; says that these works are a great nuisance : That it is often impossible to remain in his garden at all for smoke and smell , and that water , set down in the garden , becomes loaded with sooty matter : That his family is very much annoyed by the works ; that every window is sometimes obliged to be put down , the smell being so strong that it is enough to suffocate one : That the smoke that arises from the retort-house is worse than that from the chimney : That plants do not grow in his garden , and that linen is often obliged to be rinsed out , in consequence of the falling of the blacks : That , when the wind is blowing , he has perceived the smell at a considerable distance : That he remains in his present residence very much against his will , and only because he has been established there so long , that his customers know where to find him . We have given the testimony of the inhabitants , who reside in the vicinity of the Westminster Gas-Works thus fully , because these works in particular , as we before observed , were held forth as having adopted improvements in the modes of manufacture which entirely removed all nuisance . To whatever extent these improvements may have benefited the proprietors of the gas-works , they cannot be said to have promoted , in an equal degree , the welfare of those who live in their vicinity : for , in all its forms , the nuisance continues unabated ; and while the few , who are enabled to flee from it , quit the district , those , whose business or whose property oblige them to remain , are compelled to live on in discomfort and disgust , to see their property daily deteriorating in value their old neighbours driven awayand a new and inferior class of people settling around and among them . From the Westminster , we pass on to another great establishment - - the Imperial , erected only within these few years , and beginning its operations since the year 1823 that is , since the introduction of the improvements , which are said so entirely to have banished nuisance from Coal gas-works and where , it is to be presumed , they have been fully adopted . Mr WILLIAM SMI \\' re is a contractor and surveyor ; is also inspector of the Pancras Union Estates for the last seven years , and collector of rents ; is also proprietor of four houses in Essex Street , the end of which street is about 60 yards from the Gas-Works of the Imperial Company , situate in Maiden Lane , and which were established about three years ago . He states , that , since their establishment , the houses in the surrounding neighbourhood have diminished very much in value ; that many , let before at L . 28 , have fallen to L . 24 and L . 22 ; that many are now unoccupied , which were occupied before ; and that the people who now inhabit them , are of an inferior class ; that , in Suffolk Street , east and west , some of the houses are empty ; and many of the tenants of others have given notice to quit , and others must do so , not being able to let their lodgings , in consequence of the gas-works ; that many of these houses were taken by tenants , who underlet a part of them , and that they must now take in the inferior class of people who work in the gas-works , or they will not be able to let them at all . He states , that he smells the vapour of the gas works at his own house , a distance of more than 300 yards , and even farther still . Before the gas-works were established , the neighbourhood was very pleasant , and it was then difficult to get a house in Suffolk Street , and the inhabitants were of a respectable class . Since that period , the value of property has most materially suffered : that , since the establishment of the gas-works , when people come to look at the houses , they ask , “ What is that place ? ” — when told , “ the Gas-Works ; ” — “ Then I would not live here , if you would give me the house for nothing . \" Mr SAMUEL COOPER , lives in Lower Edmund Street , where he has two houses , and one in Suffolk Street ; says , that , since the establishment of the gas-works , he has been obliged to take L . 5 less for a house than he did three years ago : that the gas-work is a great nuisance , and the smoke very great when the retorts are charged ; that he has a house near the works , which is not worth so much by L . 50 or L . 60 as before they were established ; that the inhabitants generally complain of the nuisance ; and that , if they brighten their brasses in the morning , they are turned to a brown by night . Mr GEORGE WILLIAMS is a conveyancing clerk , lives in Suffolk Street East , not above 60 or 70 yards from the Imperial Gas-Works at Battlebridge ; has lived there eight years , and before the gas-works were erected there ; has found very great annoyance from the smell , which , at times , when the wind sets in from the north , it is almost impossible to bear ; says that the smell enters his house ; On our way from Khopong , along the ancient river-bed which forms the pathway to Boatlanama , I found a species of cactus , being the third I have seen in the country , namely , one in the colony with a bright red flower , one at Lake Ngami , the flower of which was liver-colored , and the present one , flower unknown . That the plant is uncommon may be inferred from the fact that the Bakwains find so much difficulty in recognizing the plant again after having once seen it , that they believe it has the power of changing its locality . On the 21st of January we reached the wells of Boatlanama , and found them for the first time empty . Lopepe , which I had formerly seen a stream running from a large reedy pool , was also dry . The hot salt spring of Serinane , east of Lopepe , being undrinkable , we pushed on to Mashue for its delicious waters . In traveling through this country , the olfactory nerves are frequently excited by a strong disagreeable odor . This is caused by a large jet-black ant named \" Leshonya \" . It is nearly an inch in length , and emits a pungent smell when alarmed , in the same manner as the skunk . The scent must be as volatile as ether , for , on irritating the insect with a stick six feet long , the odor is instantly perceptible . Occasionally we lighted upon land tortoises , which , with their unlaid eggs , make a very agreeable dish . We saw many of their trails leading to the salt fountain ; they must have come great distances for this health-giving article . In lieu thereof they often devour wood-ashes . It is wonderful how this reptile holds its place in the country . When seen , it never escapes . The young are taken for the sake of their shells ; these are made into boxes , which , filled with sweet-smelling roots , the women hang around their persons . When older it is used as food , and the shell converted into a rude basin to hold food or water . It owes its continuance neither to speed nor cunning . Its color , yellow and dark brown , is well adapted , by its similarity to the surrounding grass and brushwood , to render it indistinguishable ; and , though it makes an awkward attempt to run on the approach of man , its trust is in its bony covering , from which even the teeth of a hyaena glance off foiled . When this long-lived creature is about to deposit her eggs , she lets herself into the ground by throwing the earth up round her shell , until only the top is visible ; then covering up the eggs , she leaves them until the rains begin to fall and the fresh herbage appears ; the young ones then come out , their shells still quite soft , and , unattended by their dam , begin the world for themselves . Their food is tender grass and a plant named thotona , and they frequently resort to heaps of ashes and places containing efflorescence of the nitrates for the salts these contain . This erroneous opinion appears to have been based on the effects occasionally produced by the poison on animals : it is not in any way supported by observations on man . The evidence derivable from the taste and odour of this poison is , in some instances , of importance . The taste is described by Dr . Christison as pungent ; some state that it is hot , others that it is bitter . ( Pereira . ) In one fatal case ( December 1856 ) deceased complained , on swallowing about two drachms of the poison by mistake , that it had a bitter taste . When the common acid is mixed with organic liquids , a taste is not likely to be perceptible unless the dose is large . With regard to the odour , Dr . Christison states that when diffused , it has a distant resemblance to that of bitter almonds ; but it is accompanied with a peculiar impression of acridity on the nostrils and back of the throat . ( Op . cit . 752 . ) Orfila also says that it is similar to that of bitter almonds : — this is , indeed , the common impression . There is , however , a difference between these odours ; but the difference is not perceptible to the senses of all , and the only practical point requiring notice is , that the diluted odour of bitter almonds would probably be pronounced by many persons to indicate the presence of prussic acid , especially if there existed any suspicion of violent death . Even experienced medical men have to my knowledge been deceived on this point . There are some who are unable to perceive the odour of prussic acid when it exists in large proportion , whether mixed with water or other liquids ; while others , again , are peculiarly susceptible of it . With some , it does not affect the olfactory nerves at all , but produces merely a sense of constriction in the throat . These facts appear to me to explain , — why , on being called to a case of poisoning by this acid , or during the examination of a body , some medical men perceive the odour while others do not . When many have to form a judgment on this subject , it is much more common to find disagreement than unanimity . In a case seen by Dr . Christison , in which a man had swallowed a large dose of prussic acid , there was no odour in the breath , near the patient , nor in any part of the room . Two persons could not perceive any odour in six ounces of the warm fluid freshly drawn from the stomach by the pump . ( Ed . Month . Journal , Eeb . 1850 , p . 97 . ) On other occasions the odour may be concealed by peppermint , tobacco , or other odours . In a case communicated to me in May 1850 , by Mr . Rake , a man swallowed a large dose of prussic acid , and was observed walking and smoking a pipe . He was found dead in a privy very shortly afterwards ; but although the body was still warm , the smell of tobacco-smoke from the mouth completely overpowered and concealed the odour of prussic acid . On opening the body , the smell of the acid was at once perceptible . The regiment \\' s colours were now carried on board on the 23d in great state , which put a final close to the expedition , but without receiving any honours from Fort Zealandia , not a single gun being fired , nor even the flag hoisted on the occasion , to the great mortification of Colonel Fourgeoud , though in effect it was chiefly owing to his own neglect , as he had never given the Governor official notice of his intended departure . The baggage was also sent on board the ships ; and a gentleman of the name of Van Heyst entertained the marines at his private expence with three hundred bottles of wine , fruit , & c . I have often remarked the hospitality and generosity of these people , which I now also once more experienced , receiving various presents of fruits and preserves from my numerous friends , to refresh me at sea while on the voyage ; amongst the preserves were the female pappayas , the male bearing no fruit . This grows on a grey trunk , near twenty feet high , straight , and pithy within , the top being covered with a crown , and only fourteen or sixteen diverging leaves , extremely large and digitated . The fruit grows close to the trunk ; the flower or blossom has a most delicious fragrance . When ripe , it is the size and shape of a water-melon , and turns from green to yellow , but its pulp is more firm and solid : the inner pulp is soft and slimy , filled with innumerable seeds . This fruit at full maturity is cut in pieces and boiled , when it eats like English turnips ; but they use it principally for confectionary and sweetmeats , when young , and with its blossoms being both extremely delicate and wholesome . I had also sent me some fine preserved ginger ; this is the root of a kind of reedy stalk , that never exceeds two feet in height , with long , narrow pointed leaves . These roots are tuberous , flattish , small , and clustered in many different shapes , not unlike pig-potatoes , and of nearly the same colour in the inside , but fibrous , acid , hot , and aromatic ; the smell is highly fragrant : it is well known to be not only an agreeable preserve , but in many cases an excellent medicine . But to proceed . On the 24th of July , the sails being bent to the yards , we at last proceeded in corps to take leave of his Excellency the Governor of the colony , who , while he still received us with the greatest politeness , yet gave our hero to understand , that were his colours now to be sent on board , they should most certainly be saluted with those honours which indisputably were their due . After which he sent the whole corps of Society officers to the head-quarters in state , to wish us a prosperous voyage to Holland ; and in this contest of etiquette his Excellency most assuredly led the van ; for hinting which , however , to some of Fourgeoud \\' s favourites , I had nearly engaged myself once more in a serious quarrel . Our men , who had been on board since the 18th , being now joined by their officers , the poor remains of this fine regiment were thus finally embarked , and in the highest flow of spirits , expecting to set sail the following day for Europe ; while ( one alone excepted ) every countenance wore the appearance of happiness and joy ; and nothing indeed could equal the exultation of the few surviving troops , when the next morning the orders were issued for the ships to weigh anchor and put to sea . But it was by fate ordained that their eager hopes and expectations once more should be blasted : for on the very moment of departure , a ship entered the river with dispatches , inclosing an order for the regiment immediately to re-enter the woods , and remain in the colony until relieved by fresh troops to be sent out from Holland for that purpose . The SINCERE THANKS of his Serene Highness the Prince of Orange were now read to the men from the quarter-deck of each vessel , \" for the manly and spirited conduct they had displayed during so long a trial , and so many great and unprecedented hardships ; \" but as they concluded with orders for the troops to disembark , and remain in this dreadful service , I never saw dejection , disappointment , and despair so strongly marked : while at this moment I , who but just before had been completely miserable , was now in turn the only one who was not depressed with sorrow . In the midst of this gloomy scene , the men were ordered to give three cheers , which the marines on board one of the vessels absolutely refused to comply with : Colonel Scyburg , and unluckily myself , were in consequence ordered to compel them ; which he undertook , with a cane in one hand , and a loaded pistol cocked in the other . Knowing his temper to be fiery and irascible , what did I not feel at this moment ? I suddenly leapt into the boat that lay along-side , where , after haranguing those few that leaned over the gunwale , I promised the ship \\' s crew twenty gallons of Holland \\' s gin if they would only begin the melancholy chorus . Then mounting again the quarter-deck , I acquainted the Colonel that all were now ready and willing to obey his commands ; we then re-entered the boat , and in shoving off had the satisfaction to receive three hearty cheers from the sailors , in which joined a few marines , but with such languid looks and heavy hearts as cannot be described . A SHORT HISTORY OF DRUGS , & c . ALLOES CICOTRINA , commonly called SUCCOTRINA . IS the inspissated Juice of a Plant of that Name ; the best grows in the Island of Succotre , which if dry and when broke in the Middle appears of a dark green glassey substance , and when reduced to Powder is of a fine yellow Saffron Colour . If any Dirt , Stones , or other Rubbish is in the Package , which very often happens to the very best , the Value is uncertain ; therefore , what you buy , let it be fine and clear ; and if it be not so , sort it in the Country , taking it out of the Skins , and freeing it from Stones , Dirt and Rubbish ; for which , if you import it , you must pay the Duty , which is very high , and the Buyers will calculate the Loss in Skins , & c . at double the real Disadvantage . It will sell to much greater Advantage in Chests or Casks , from one to two hundred Weight , than in large ones , which will be above the Reach of midling Buyers . — Please to grease the Inside of the Package , to prevent its sticking to it . ALLOES HEPACTIA , or EPATICA : Is of the same Species with the Cicotrina : but instead of being of a dark green , and almost transparent when shivered into thin Pieces , is of the Colour of the Liver of an Animal ; and it frequently happens that there is a Mixture of Cicotrina in the Epatic , as well as a Mixture of Epatic in the Cicotrina , which ought to be separated in the Country . Stones , Dirt , & c . should be equally guarded against in this Article as in the Cicotrina , and the Buyer should guard against its being wet ; very good Epatic Alloes having been brought home from India almost Liquid , which the Buyers were obliged to keep till it became dry and fit to be broke into small Pieces , and capable of being reduced to Powder GUM AMMONIACUM : Is a concrete gummy substance in small Drops or Tears ; it is of a nauseous bitter Taste , but when dissolved in any liquid but Spirits , or rubbed in a Mortar with Water , resembles Milk ; it must be free from Dross , Stones , & c . and if brown will not ( though it may be as good as when it is almost white ) fetch half the Price . GUM ASSAFAETIDA . Is a concrete gummy substance , of a strong faetid smell , resembling Onions , or rather Shallots , in small Drops or Tears ; but when packt forms a massy lump . Observe , that when first broke it appears quite white within , and changes soon after to a red or purple Colour ; the brown , dingy , or dirty is of little Value : it is often mixed with Stones ; some sorts are moist , with Tears , which if clean is very good . GUM BENJAMIN , or BENZOIN . Is a concrete rosinous Gum , of a sweet aromatic Taste ; it is generally brought here in large Masses , according to the shape of the package , therefore before you buy break well into it , and see that it is full of white marble Drops . If that Sort is not to be had , the next best is the light brown sort , which breaks smooth , and is free from dross , and almost transparent ; the drossy Sort is of little Value , and the King \\' s Duty is as high upon that as the very finest . BEZOAR . The true East-India sort are smooth black-shining stones , about the size of small Hazel-Nuts , found in the Stomach of certain Animals in the East-Indies , said to be something resembling the Goat Kind ; when it is broke appears of a shining , dark , green or olive Colour , and composed of Coats or Shells one above another , so closely connected as to form a solid stone ; some prefer the Sort that goes by the Name of Porcupine Bezoar , but as it has been found of little or no efficacy in Medicine is but seldom used , the Lapis Contrayerva being used in its stead . BORAX . Is a white christaline Salt , made from Tincal in several Parts of India ; the best generally comes from China in large transparent lumps : if brown , discoloured or mealy , reduces the Value considerably ; the more it resembles white Sugar-Candy the better . CAMBOGE , or CAMBOGIUM . Is a solid concrete Juice ; the best is of a deep yellow or Orange Colour , breaks shining and free from Dross : if dull , red or crusty , reduces the Value . Chuse that which is in small Cakes or Rolls , which sells best here . CAMPHIRE , or CAMPHOR unrefined . Is a solid volatile concrete Gum , extracted from a Shrub growing in several Parts of the East Indies . The best Sort that will do for this Market must be quite white , clean , and in small transparent Grains , about the size of coarse Sand , run together ; for , if it is white , transparent , and in large lumps , and of a firm substance without Grains , it may be charged with the refined Duty . — The best Package to bring it home is Iron-bound Casks , and well pressed in ; and if the Casks were lined with Turenague , it would prevent its getting into the Wood and evaporating , it being of an exceeding subtile volatile Nature . CAMPHIRE refined . Is a Sublimation of the unrefined , and formed into Loaves or Cakes ; but the Difference of the Duties and Charges , and the easy Method of refining the rough Camphor here , will prevent its being brought to Advantage . CASSIA LIGNEA . Is the Bark of the bastard Cinnamon Tree , There are several Sorts , but the best brought home lately was from China , which was small long round Sticks , nearly of the Colour and Flavour of real Cinnamon , and is used in its stead . It cannot be too thin , for if the Bark is thick , though it be equally strong and pungent on the Palate , it will only do for distilling , and therefore not near so valuable . The second Sort of Cassia Lignea is generally got at Batavia and Ben . oclen , and is of two Sorts , one a very small Twig , about a Foot long , of a stronger pungent Flavour than Cinnamon , and sold from £15 to £20 per Cwt . The other Sort is in thick long Sticks , and nearly as pungent ; but the shape and colour makes it not so valuable , and only sells from £5 to £8 per Cwt . The way to discover the true Cinnamon Sort is to chew it , when , if it is musilaginous or slimy in the mouth , it is not near so valuable , though it is often stronger than real Cinnamon , but will foul the Cinnamon Water made from it . There is also Cassia Lignea that is of a very bright Colour and good Shape , which has little or no smell or Taste ; the breaking a handful of Sticks will ascertain the Quality almost as well as tasting , for where there is a fine Smell , there is always a strong Taste . The third Sort got at the Coast and Bengal , having very little Taste and Shape , like unto Cinnamon , but is slat , woody and shaffy , will scarce fell for the Duty and Charges ; the King \\' s Duty is £2 6s . 8d , per Cwt . equally on the worst as the best , and the Company \\' s and Discount 13 and half per Cent . on the Price it sells for . CASSIA BUDS . Appears to be the Fruit or Berries of the Cassia Tree , and resembles in some Degree a Clove , but is smaller , of a fine rich Cinnamon Flavour when fresh ; they have been but very lately introduced into Europe , and chiefly brought from China : chuse them fresh and found , free from Stalks and Dirt . CARDAMON SEEDS . Those produced on the Coast of Malabar are the best , which are contained in a three-square Pod , or Husk , rather larger than a large Pea ; very little Judgment is required in chusing them , provided they are fresh , sound , well filled Husks and of a palish Colour , and of a very grateful Smell , resembling Camphor . Care should be taken to pack them in strong sound Chests , for the least damp will turn the Husk , not only mouldy but musty , and greatly reduce its Value . COCULUS INDIA . A round blackisk Berry , generally brought from Bombay . Observe they are sound , dry and clean ; they are extremely light , being quite hollow . CUBEBS . Is a kind of Pepper , with this Difference , that it has a Tail or Stalk to each Berry , and is much more aromatic than Pepper , resembling Jamaica Pepper , called by the common People All-spice ; it is generally bought on the Malabar Coast , and should be dry , sound and clean . DRAGONS BLOOD . A red rosinous Gum , sometimes brought in oval lumps , about the Size of a Chesnut or a Pullet \\' s Egg , and sometimes in a large Mass , composed of small Grains or Tears , and if good , appears of a deep shining red colour , and when reduced to Powder changes into elegant bright Crimson : if you meet with any different from the above Account , as mixed with Dross , Dirt , or worse colour , must not give much for it , there being Dragons Blood from less than £ .10 to £40 per Cwt . that in Tears is the safest to buy , if it breaks as clear as Glass , and is when powdered of a fine Crimson red , which is the only Excellence , it being used much more in Japaniary than in physic . GALBANUM . Is a soft tenacious yellowish Gum , of a warm bitterish Taste ; the best Sort is in Masses , and when broke or cut appears composed of white small dry Tears or Drops . Chuse as above , for if you meet with it mixed with Dirt , Sticks , Bits of Cane , or other Rubbish , it will reduce the Value ; the more Aromatic it smells the better : that which is fine , has Tears in it , like other East India Gums . GUM ARABIC . Prefer the large red lumps , for the pale yellow does not sell well . Observe that it be clean and kept from Wet or Dampness ; the best Packages is strong iron-bound Casks : there is sometimes a fine transparent Sort , almost white , which will sell very well . LAC , called SHELLACK . Is thought to be a Preparation from Sticklack , and formed into thin Flakes or Shells , appears of a clear transparent deep yellow or red colour ; if specky , drossy , black , or of a Liver colour , or any ways dull and cloudy , and not transparent , it will be of little Value at this Market . LACK , called STICKLACK . Is supposed to be a kind of rosinous Wax collected by Insects , and deposited by them on round small Sticks , in such form as is commonly imported ; the best for Sale here is composed of a very deep red Gum , intermixed with Cells , ( formed by the Insects ) in which the colour is contained , and when put into Water gives a red Tincture , which is the Sort most in Esteem for dying red Morocco Leather . — Chuse the deep Red , which is here called Black , and the fewer Sticks the better ; if when chewed it does not make your Spittle of a fine red or crimson colour it is not the right Sort , and not half so valuable . SEEDLACK . Appears to be the little Lumps or Seeds that fall from the Sticklack , or some other artificial Preparation . The Consumption is very trifling in Europe ; chuse as large red clean Seeds as possible : there is a Sort of a very bright yellow , and very transparent , resembling Amber , which is used in Varnish or Lacquer , and will , if clean , bear an high Price . LACK , called CAKE , or LUMPLACK . Is the fine deep aqueous Gum separated from Sticks , and formed into Masses ; the more it resembles Sticklack the better , and ought to be free from Sticks , Dirt , & c . MOTHER OF PEARL SHELLS , ROUGH . Ought to be at least eight or nine Inches broad , and have a shining silver Colour on the Inside and the Outside free from Blotches or Scabs , otherwise they are of little Value . LONG PEPPER . Is the Fruit of a certain Plant of the Pepper kind , growing in the East Indies ; it differs very little from the other , except in Shape , from whence it takes its Name , being of a long round Form , of about an Inch , about the Size of a Goose Quill , and composed of a great Number of Seeds , set close together , about the Size of a small Pin \\' s Head . It must be sound , clean and dry , and of a dark Ash-colour ; there sometimes comes a shorter and smaller , which is not near so valuable , and the Duties are alike on both Kinds . If any Salt-water gets to it , there is no such thing as drying it , and will soon become wormy and rotten . MUSK . Appears to be a Substance like greasy clotted Blood , contained in a hairy small Bag or Pod , resembling the Cod of an Animal , weighing about an Ounce , and supposed to be found on a certain Animal in China . Chuse thin-skinned Pods that have not been cut open , for the Smell of the Musk is so powerful , that Pieces of Liver or any thing else may be mixed with it , and sometimes Lead Shot to make it heavy . It cannot be too dry , and if the Cods have been cut open , the Palp or Grain ought to be of a dark reddish brown Colour . MYRRH . Is a concrete gummy rosinous Juice , of various Colours and Sizes , the Produce of Persia , of a fine aromatic Smell , and bitter aromatic Taste ; the best that has been brought home for ten Years past was in solid lumps , from the Size of a Nutmeg to that of a Pigeon \\' s Egg , of a palish yellow Colour , and when broke appeared in the Inside of a whitish mealy Substance ; though where it breaks of a deep Orange-colour , and of a firmer Texture , and shining , it is much more preferable . There is also a brown sort , which appears of the same mealy Substance , and sells near as well The second Sort has the same Colour , Taste , and Smell ; but the Inside appears more glassy and solid , and generally in less Lumps . The third Sort is in brown , red , dirty , small , and frequently mixed with ordinary inferior Gum , which , by being mixed with it , will contract the Smell and Flavour of the true Gum . The very best is sometimes mixed with Pieces that are very drossy and light , and often with very small Gum and Dust ; which , though ever so genuine , will not sell for near the Price that the large will . OLIBANUM . Is a rosinous Gum , mostly brought from Turkey , and sometimes from the East Indies , in small round Drops or Tears , of a pale yellowish Colour , and very rarely transparent , being in general hardly pellucid , as it is a Species of Frankincense ; it has an aromatic Smell , but rather a disagreeable acrid astringent Taste , and when chewed will be of a milky Colour . If it is run into a Mass with but few Tears in it , and mixed with Dirt or Rubbish , it will not do for this Market . OPOPONAX . A concrete gummy rosinous Juice , the Produce of Persia ; the best brought home , by the way of the East Indies , is in reddish or Orange-coloured Drops or Tears , and when broke the Inside appears of a pale yellow , intermixed with white Specks ; it has a very fragrant Smell , something like Sellery Roots , and a pleasant bitter acrid Taste . It is sometimes very light and kecksey , mixed with small Bits of Canes and Sticks , but that always sells low , in Proportion to the Quantity of Gum . RHUBARB . The Root of a Plant growing in China , of our English Dock kind , but considerably larger . The Natives cut the Root into round Pieces , about three or four Inches long , and dry it for Sale , which is well known in Europe by the Name of round Rhubarb ; and sometimes they cut it down the middle of the Root , and afterwards into four or five Inch long Pieces , which drys the better , and when fit for Sale appears flat . For these four or five Years past the flat Kind has sold £25 per Cent . better than the round of the same goodness . Observe what you buy has the rough discoloured outside Coat pared off , which it attracts in drying , and that it is quite dry and not the least Dampness or Greeness left in it ; the Outside to be of a pale yellow , and the Inside of a pale red Nutmeg Colour : and it cannot smell too fresh , and must be free from Worm Holes . To avoid being cheated , break several Pieces through the Middle , it being frequently of a very good Colour on the Outside , but quite green , and often black , and almost rotten in the middle . SAGO . Is generally thought to be the Pith of a Tree and manufactured into small round Grains , and brought from China or other Parts of India , though the Mallaca is the principal Market , and the best Sago ; what is most preferable here is of a red Bloom Colour , and dissolves very easily in warm or hot Water , and makes a very fine Jelly ; that which boils red is always preferred : that which is brown is not near so good , and it ought also to be free from Dust . Care should be taken of the Package , which is best in Oak Casks ; the least damp will render it Musty , and good for nothing . SAL ARMONIAC . Is a manufactured Salt , said to be prepared from Camel \\' s or other Animal \\' s Urine , or Dung , in the hot Climates , about Persia and Arabia . The Sort generally brought here is in large round convex Cakes , or conical Loaves , in some Degree resembling a Sugar Loaf , about six or eight Pounds Weight each . Very little Judgment is required in chusing it : the Taste ought to be sharp and penetrating , its Colour white and clear ; sometimes Soot or Sticks is in it , but the less the better . TINCAL , or unrefined BORAX . In the Manner we have it brought home appears to be a natural Salt , produced in the Province of Bengal , being mixed with Sand and Earth ; the best is in large Pieces , of the Size of a Hasel-Nut , and sometimes , though very seldom , larger , and of a clear and almost transparent Colour , when broke resembling Allum , though seldom so clear , but generally mixed with Dirt , Sand , & c . Another Sort has been imported , about the Size of a Grain of Wheat , of a yellowish Colour , resembling brown Sugar Candy , when broke into small Pieces , which was very good ; but the worst is what is mixed with Sand , Dirt , and other Rubbish . They have a wrong Notion in Madrass and Bengal to mix it with Oil and Butter-Milk , when tight Casks would bring it home better , and save the Expence of paying Duty on Water , & c . which in the refining must be all evaporated , as refined Borax must be dry enough to be reduced to a fine Powder . TURMERICK . A Root growing in China and Bengal , brought home in Pieces , about an Inch long , of a warm aromatick Taste , much resembling Ginger . The China Sort sells the best , being about the Thickness of a Man \\' s little Finger ; smooth yellow Surface , and fine pale red , or rather Orange-colour , and the more rosinous the better , when broke . The Bengal Sort is not yellow on the Outside as the China Sort is , but when broke is almost of as good a colour , but very often breaks black , which renders it of less Value : Turmerick is also very subject to be Worm-eaten , which will greatly reduce its Value ; and the least wet or damp will spoil it for Use , on which account tight Casks is far preferable to Bags , in which it is too often imported . Drugs not much in Demand , or the Produce of other Parts , as well as India . AMBERGREASE . Is a bituminous Substance , almost as solid as Fullers-earth , chiefly found floating on the Sea , or on Shores ; it is a fine Perfume , of a greyish or Ash-colour , which is the best , and of great Value ; the black or dirty is ordinary , and if it is adulterated with Rosin , & c . a red hot Knitting Needle or Wire will discover it , as true Ambergrease will not melt by Heat : it chiefly comes from North-America . BALM , or BALSAM of GILEAD . Is generally supposed to be the Produce of Arabia , and sometimes has been imported from the East Indies . The true has a surprising odoriferous fragrant Smell , a pungent but very agreeable bitter astringent Taste , and of a turbid thickish Consistence , of a yellowish colour ; but so little has come these many Years , that a stranger must be very cautious how he buys it , as every Species of Turpentine will mix with it . CANTHARIDES . Are Flies as large as Bees , of a very fine green and gold Colour , and are chiefly imported from Spain and Italy ; though there are some in India , but the length of the Voyage prevents their being brought to Advantage ; though if packed in Chests , lined with Tutenague as Tea is , and very fresh when brought , might answer . CASSIA MUNIAR . Is a bulbous Root of the Zedoary kind , but more resembling in shape Turmerick ; it breaks of a fine Orange-colour , of a fragrant Smell , and aromatic Taste . CASSIA FISTULA . Is a long blackish Pod or Fruit , an Inch diameter , and from one to two Feet long , containing a sweetish Pulp , which is the only valuable Part of it , and comes very fresh from the West-India Islands ; if the East-India Sort were better , the Pulp would dry up in the Voyage . CHINA ROOT . There are two Sorts , the East and West-India ; the East-India is hard , knotty , and rosinous , of a very pale red Colour , but of very little Use . CINNABAR , or VERMILLION . The only Sort to be brought from the East-Indies is the Native Cinnabar ; which , by being strongly impregnated with Quicksilver , is very heavy , and generally comes in small lumps , seldom so large as a Pea ; it is of a bright shining colour , and when powdered of a fine red , which is its principal Quality , it being chiefly used in Painting . CIVET . A soft unctious Substance , generally of a dusky white , or rather brown Colour , supposed to be found in a Pod or Bag growing on the lower Part of the Belly of the Civet Cat ; it is a Perfume of a strong and rather disagreeable Smell in Substance ; but the Perfumers know how to render it very grateful , by using it in very small Quantities . COLOGUINTIDA . Is a dried Fruit , as large as an Apple , and very like one that has been pared ; it comes from Turkey , is very light , and extremely bitter , and full of Seeds ; which , though bitterer than the Pulp , are of no Value . CORAL . The best is got in Italy or Turkey , and large Quantities of the fine Sort yearly carried to India . It grows at the bottom of the Sea , and is both white and red ; the red is the most valuable , is as solid as Stone , and will bear a fine Polish ; the larger the more valuable : the small Sort is used in Medicine . DIAGREDIUM , or SCAMONY . Is the inspissated Juice of a Plant reduced to a Consistence not unlike Spanish Juice , of a brownish Colour , and of a purgative Quality , and chiefly comes from Turkey ; but so much adulteratep , that the oldest Druggists can scarcely ascertain its real Qualities . FOLIUM INDIA , or MALABATHRUM . Is the Leaf of a Plant or Tree , resembling the Leaf of a Bay Tree , but much larger , and differs from that and most other Leaves , by having three Stems , or strong Fibres , running from the Stalk to the Top of the Leaf . COSTUS DULCIS Is an aromatic firm Root , resembling Spikenard in Smell , but of little use . JUNEUS ODORATUS , or SWEET CANE . Is a small aromatic Reed , of a Straw Colour , but little in use . GALLINGALS . Are generally brought home in short knotty Pieces , about an inch and half long , about the Size of Turmerick , of a pale red Colour , bitter Taste , and aromatic Smell . GREEN , or PRESERVED GINGER . The Root boiled when just taken out of the Ground with Water and Sugar , to such a Consistence and Time that the Syrup enters into the Pores of the Ginger , and will preserve the Flavour for several Years . The best comes in small lumps of a pale yellow , and almost transparent ; the ordinary appears dark and brown , and when broke has small Strings or Fibres . The Barbadoes Sort sells for more than double the Price that India does , which is owing to the Root being taken out of the Ground before it is full grown , and has contracted the stringy Quality ( West-India Ginger , when dry , being full of Strings and Fibres ) and the Syrup made with white Sugar , and often Sells at 3s . 6d . to 5s . per Pound , when India seldom sells higher than 2s . and often much lower . GOA STONES . A factitious Preparation of mineral Substances , mixed with Perfume , in a round or oval Shape , and gilt ; it is , ( where the Gilding is rubbed off ) brownish , but the Inside is of a Straw Colour : it is of very little Demand . GUM ANIMI , or COPAL GUM ELIMI ; come very cheap from America . But if any fine Gum Animi can be procured in India , it will sell for a great Price ; it should be of a fine pale yellow , and as transparent as Glass , and must dissolve in Spirits of Wine , and is not much harder than Rosin , and resembles transparent Amber so much , that Cane Heads have been made of it , and sold for Amber . GUM SAGAPENUM , GUM SARCOCOLLA , GUM TRAGACANTH ; come cheap from Turkey . But if any Sagapenum can be procured in India , it will fetch a good Price ; it in some Measure resembles Assafaetida , but is in less Tears , and smells like Garlick instead of Onions which Assasaetida does . LAPIS TUTIAE : The sublimate Part collected by Means of Sticks , on the uppermost Part of Furnaces when a certain Metal in the East Indies is fluxed , by which Means it receives a tubelated Form , and generally appears of a Mouse Colour ; it is of little Use , and made in England the Copper Works , and therefore not worth importing . LIGNUM ALOES , or ALOES WOOD . What is brought to Europe is in little hard ponderous Pieces , or Chips ; when burnt , or reduced to Powder , has a bitterish aromatic Taste , and fragrant Smell , but little in Use ; but a small Quantity of the true would fetch a high Price ; a Ton would over-do the Market . MASTICK WHITE , MASTICK RED ; brought from Turkey . Lump Mastick has been brought from India , but sold for a poor Price ; it ought to be in Tears , of the Size of a small Pea , and as transparent as Amber , but a paler Colour . MIRABOLANES . Are a dried Fruit , resembling a Plumb ; there were formerly five Sorts , but never in any Demand , though they are said to be used as Efficacious in Madness : there are very few in London , and a small Quantity of fresh ( for there have been some a hundred Years old ) might sell well . OIL of CINNAMON . Very nice Judgment is required to distinguish the genuine from the Cassia , or adulterated Sort ; the true will sink in Water , and so it will if loaded with Loaf Sugar ; the more it resembles Cinnamon the better , and if true will be very hot upon the Tongue . OIL of NUTMEGS , OIL of CLOVES , OIL of MACE . Should all resemble the Spices from whence they are drawn , the Oil of Cloves and Nutmegs , which we import from Holland , are liquid ; but the Oil of Mace is in square Cakes , and resembles the Substance of Butter , only rather firmer and perhaps none of them are true , as all those Spices are so powerful as to bear a great Mixture . OPIUM . The concrete Juice of the Poppy ; it chiefly comes from Turkey , where they prepare it much better than what comes from India , which is much softer and fouler than the Turkey , which sometimes come dry enough to break like Spanish Liquorish , though the East India Climate , even without the help of Fire , might evaporate the Moisture . SEED , or RAGGED PEARL . Is found in the Pearl Fish , of an uneven Shape , seldom so large as a small Pea , and the only Sort in Use . SENNA LEAVES . Come cheap from Turkey , and much brighter and cleaner than any that have been brought from India , which generally are foul and full of Stalks , and of a darker colour , and not near so fresh . SPIKENARD . Is a small Root , from which issue several very small Fibres , resembling a Bunch or Brush , about an Inch long , and very light in weight , of a darkish brown Colour ; it has an aromatic but rather disagreeable Smell : be careful that it is free from Dust or Earth . STORAX CALAMITA , or STORAX in TEARS . Is a fine odoriferous Gum , sometimes in small Drops or Tears , and often brought home in Masses , with Saw-dust , Sand , & c . It generally comes from Turkey or Italy ; the fine greatly resembles fine Gum Benjamin , but is generally moisiter . TAMARINDS . The long Pod or Fruit of the Tamarind Tree , which grows in Pods as large as ripe Beans ; it is taken out of the Shell , and preserved in Sugar , the less of which the better , provided there is enough to keep the Pulp moist : the West India is red ; there is red , brown and black , brought from ihe East Indies , but the black is the most valuable , and the more Pulp and sewer Stones the better ; they are of a very fine acid , more pleasant than the Juice of Lemons , and make much wholesomer Punch . JAPAN EARTH . Improperly so called , as by Experiments it appears to be the Juice of some vegetable Fruit boiled to a hard consistence , like Spanish Juice , in hard Lumps , which ought to break of a brown shining Colour , and of an astringent Taste ; it was formerly , when Bohea Tea was more esteemed than green , used in dying green Tea , and other Leaves of a Bohea Colour . Two or three Tons would sell very well , but more would render it of little Value , the Consumption being small . WORMSEED . Is a small chaffy Seed , of a light yellow Colour , of a fragrant Smell , and a sine bitter Taste , and in all Probability the Seed of Wormwood . What we have had from India was so small , dusty , chaffy , and full of Stalks , that it did not sell for a third of the Price of that imported from Turkey . YELEOW SAUNDERS . A pale yellowish Wood , of a pleasant Smell , bitterish aromatic Taste , which leaves an agreeable kind of Pungency ; it is generally brought in large thick Logs , and Care should be taken that it is quite sound and solid . There is a Sort of white Saunders , which perhaps is nothing more than the yellow with the Sap on it , and should be avoided , as Rosewood , notwithstanding its being of a dark Colour , is in some Measure white on the Outside , but that Part will produce no Oli . OIL of RHODIUM , or ROSEWOOD . Though never imported from India , might be extracted from the Chips of large Pieces , which are made into Tea Chests , & c . and the small Branches of the Tree , in the same Manner as the Oil of Cinnamon , & c . are ; the Wood would not answer importing , but the Oil may , as the Chymists and Perfumers sell it at 14s . an Ounce . ZEDOARY ROOT . There are two Sorts brought from India , the yellow and the white , both of them generally cut into small Pieces of different Shapes , though it appears by the Shape of them , that the Root is originally round or oval , and only cut for the Conveniency of drying them better ; the yellow has the Appearance of large Turmerick , but a more agreeable aromatic Taste ; the white is more rosinous on the Inside , and of a pale dusky white Colour , and more valuable . Observe that it is sound , and free from Worms , or Rottenness , and the larger and heavier , if dry , the better . Various Articles . ARRACK . Is a fine Cane Spirit , supposed to be distilled from Rice , formerly of great Esteem in England , but the high Duties has lessened the Demand so , that fifty or sixty Leagers are sufficient for a Year \\' s Consumption . What you intend for Sale must be full Proof , clean , and have no bad Smell . ARRANGOES , Are made from the rough Cornelian Stone , or something of that kind , and formed into different Shapes , and bored through the Middle in India : the chief Demand for them here are to send to Africa , where they are much used on Strings as Ornaments . Religion is the greatest enemy to religion , the false to the true , favos etiam vespae faciunt , Waspes also make combes , though instead of honey we find gun-powder . XC . The grub or worme in it \\' s first state or life is a rude creature , not much delighting in it selfe , lesse delighting others , but when it is shut up to be transmuted , then it is for a time a formelesse lump , without any beauty or comelinesse : but waite a few dayes and the parts will appeare , life will move in these yet imperfect members which are at length perfectly formed , and then it comes forth an agill usefull creature . And as God doth not make the whole fabrick of the world at once , though it wa • not impossible to him being a God almighty , but in the space of six dayes , so doth God deale with his children : when God creates in his children a new heart , he suffers first their hearts to be as a rude and massie lumpe , full of darknesse , and then sends his holy Spirit into their hearts , which illuminates them , and drives away those black clouds of darknesse and ignorance , and then he breathes into them the sweete ayre of his Spirit ; And thus out of Tohu and B • hu is the new creature formed . XCI . We should doe as the Bee when she hath sucked sweetnesse from the flower , she better concocts and refires it in her owne bodie , and so it becomes pure honey . Thus when we have sucked any precious truth , we should by holy meditation concoct it in our hearts , and then it would become pure profitable honey . XCII . The young Bees as soone as they have past their second birth , and transmuted their shape and qualities , and are winged and strengthened to flie abroad , presently fall to their worke , and imitate the elder Bees . And so doth the beleeving soule , as soone as it is borne againe , strengthened and winged with grace from God , makes after him in workes of obedience , holinesse and praises , imitates the examples of the Prophets and Apostles , as they have followed Christ . Let disadvantages be what will be , you cannot keepe young Bees in the hive when once transmuted and winged , no more can you keepe the regenerate soule from working the workes of God , and with holy praises ascending to heaven , when they are once under the line of Christs everlasting love and feele it shine mighty hot in them with full face , with perpendicular rayes , but with a present rapture make holinesse their worke and Hallelujahs all their language . XCIII . Honey is gathered with much art from great variety of trees and flowers ; and joy is a honey , a fragrancy made from above with much picking , choosing , and composing . XCIV . Bees are neate sweete and cleanly creatures , naturally abhorring stinking places and strong senting herbes . It is true they gather of the flowers of some weeds which are bitter and offensive , but yet the flowers are not ( as Broome , Henbane , Mayweed ) as your tast and smell may informe you . But where the flowers participate of the ill sent of the herbes they meddle not at all ( as Gallopsia , Cheesrunnet ) . And Christ puts • io toades in his bosome ( saith one ) nor beleevers wicked men into the intimacy of their affections , puritie will bosome puritie , corruption cannot delight in uncorruption , Heterogeneals will not incorporate , light and darknesse are inconsistent , gracious and ungodly men cannot live and linke together . A good heart cannot with more pleasure rest it selfe then in Gods resting place , in Christs societie , in the way of the Spirit , in the Ministery of Angels , and fellowship of the Saints . The odour , for instance , of a distiller ’ s fermentation , who works from a mixture of raw corn and malt , is always as different as night from day , from that of a brewer ’ s , who has a sound fermentation , and works with good malt . The first has always a foetid odour , while that of the other is highly vinous , pungent and aromatic . I have already said , that the nose is almost a sure guide to an experienced brewer , in ascertaining whether his fermentation is going on well or ill . But I would wish to impress this point more particularly on the mind , than I have perhaps formerly done . An experienced brewer with a very sensitive smell , should be able to judge even by walking through a brew-house , whether or not it is in trim , and I again repeat that no man who has not both a very sensitive smell and taste , can be a good brewer . Many I know will say that this is a fanciful idea . But how often do we see that even one man , who is acknowledged to have a good taste for wine or beer , will guide the opinions of a large majority in any company , as to the good or bad qualities of the beverage they are then drinking . The majority , perhaps , are not the best judges ; indeed I have seen men so devoid of both taste and smell , that it made very little difference , whether putrid or fresh food were presented to them . It is remarkable , however , that though a piece of beef or mutton , plunged in quicksilver , and kept in this degree of heat , yield air , the bulk of which is inflammable , and contracts no putrid smell ( at least , in a day or two ) a mouse treated in the same manner , yields the proper putrid effluvium , as indeed the smell sufficiently indicates . That the putrid effluvium will mix with water seems to be evident from the following experiment . If a mouse be put into a jar full of water , standing with its mouth inverted in another vessel of water , a considerable quantity of elastic matter ( and which may , therefore , be called air ) will soon be generated , unless the weather be so cold as to check all putrefaction . After a short time , the water contracts an extremely fetid and offensive smell , which seems to indicate that the putrid effluvium pervades the water , and affects the neighbouring air ; and since , after this , there is often no increase of the air , that seems to be the very substance which is carried off through the water , as fast as it is generated ; and the offensive smell is a sufficient proof that it is not fixed air . For this has a very agreeable flavour , whether it be produced by fermentation , or extracted from chalk by oil of vitriol ; affecting not only the mouth , but even the nostrils ; with a pungency which is peculiarly pleasing to a certain degree , as any person may easily satisfy himself , who will chuse to make the experiment . If the water in which the mouse was immersed , and which is saturated with the putrid air , be changed , the greater part of the putrid air , will , in a day or two , be absorbed , though the mouse continues to yield the putrid effluvium as before ; for as soon as this fresh water becomes saturated with it , it begins to be offensive to the smell , and the quantity of the putrid air upon its surface increases as before . I kept a mouse producing putrid air in this manner for the space of several months . Six ounce measures of air not readily absorbed by water , appeared to have been generated from one mouse , which had been putrefying eleven days in confined air , before it was put into a jar which was quite filled with water , for the purpose of this observation . Air thus generated from putrid mice standing in water , without any mixture of common air , extinguishes flame , and is noxious to animals , but not more so than common air only tainted with putrefaction . It is exceedingly difficult and tedious to collect a quantity of this putrid air , not miscible in water , so very great a proportion of what is collected being absorbed by the water in which it is kept ; but what that proportion is , I have not endeavoured to ascertain . It is probably the same proportion that that part of fixed air , which is not readily absorbed by water , bears to the rest ; and therefore this air , which I at first distinguished by the name of the putrid effluvium , is probably the same with fixed air , mixed with the phlogistic matter , which , in this and other processes , diminishes common air . The first Buds of Ribes Nigra infused in Wines , especially Rhenish , makes it diuretick , and more fragrant in Smell and Taste , and so doth Clary . The Inconvenience is , that the Wine becomes more heady , for which Elder Flowers added to the Clary is a Remedy , which also betters the Fragancy thereof , as ’ tis manifest in Elder-Vinegar ; but these Flowers are apt to make the Wine ropy . To help brown Malaga and Spanish Wines , take Powder of Orras-Roots , and Salt-Petre , of each four Ounces , the Whites of eight Eggs , whereto add as much Salt as will make a Brine , put this Mixture into the Wine , and mix them with a Staff . To meliorate muddy and tawny Clarets . Take of Rain-water two Pints , the Yelks of eight Eggs , Salt an Handful , beat them well , let them stand six Hours before you put them into the Cask , then use the Rod , and in three Days it will come to itself . To amend the Taste and Smell of Malaga . Take of the best Almonds four Pounds , make therewith , and with sufficient Quantity of the Wine to be cured , an Emulsion , then take the Whites and Yelks of twelve Eggs , beat them together with a Handful of Salt , put them into the Pipe , using the Rod . To amend the Smell and Taste of French and Rhenish which are foul . Take to an Auln of the Wine , of Honey one Pound , of Elder-Flowers a Handful , Orras Powder an Ounce , one Nutmeg , a few Cloves , boil them in a sufficient Quantity of the Wine to be cured , to the Consumption of half ; when ’ tis cold , strain and use it with the Rod ; some add a little Salt . If the Wine be sweet enough , add of Spirits of Wine one Pound to a Hogshead , and give the Cask a strong Scent . Spirit of Wine makes any Wine brisk , and fines it without the former Mixture . The Local Board are restrained by the injunction from turning lime water into the river , on the plea that it would destroy the fish ; but the experience at Leicester shows that this is not a necessary consequence of treating the sewage with lime . There , however , the lime water does not enter the river ; sufficient reservoir space is allowed for its precipitation before the effluent water is discharged . Mr . Burns , the local Surveyor of Ely , having , as early as 1834 , made some successful experiments in treating gas water with clay , was induced recently to apply it , in conjunction with lime , for deodorizing the sewage , on completion of the drainage works of Ely . Sewage works have been erected at the outfall in which the experiment has been in operation for some time , and it is stated with complete success . At the time of my visit the place was certainly quite free from offensive smell ; but the collecting tank has not yet been opened to try the effect of the manure . It is found that one ton of clay is sufficient to deodorize 600 tons of sewage as at present discharged at Ely ; but , as only a portion of the houses have waterclosets as yet , the liquid is comparatively weak . It is expected that every house will in the course of the present year be connected with the sewers , when it is supposed that about double the weight of clay will be required for the same quantity of sewage . As the sewage discharges into the mixing tank A ( Drawing No . 3 . ) , a stream of clay water falls from a cistern B above , and passes with the sewage alternately into one of two reservoirs C below , whence the water filters upwards through a layer of charcoal and sand , and discharges by the outfall drain to the river . It is proposed to pass the solid matter daily into the emptying chamber D , and to mix it with dry clay powder and peat charcoal , or with fine dry ashes , when it will be fit for removal and use as manure . The furnace E shewn in the section is intended for consuming the foul gases from the sewers , and for heating an oven for drying clay and peat for mixing with the wet manure . When the drainage works will be complete it is proposed to add a series of open tanks , with other filters of charcoal and sand , through which the effluent water will pass before discharge . An attempt has been made for some time at Hitchin to intercept the solid matter of the sewage in a series of reservoirs and open pits at the outfall of the new drainage works , without any means of deodorizing , or arrangements for precipitating , straining , or filtering . As might be expected , the process has not been successful . An action has been decided against the Local Board for pollution of the river , which will necessitate the adoption of more complete arrangements . The gas for lighting the Dartmoor Prison has been manufactured for the last five years from the peat with which that neighbourhood abounds , and some very interesting results are being elicited in the process by Mr . Watts , the Resident Engineer , by whom the system was introduced . The peat charcoal and the ammoniacal liquor , two of the products of the manufacture , are mixed with the solid night-soil of the establishment , and with bone-dust , to form a solid manure , which is used on the neighbouring lands . The liquid refuse of the premises is pumped up and applied for irrigation , as will be described further on . It may be useful to mention , with reference to the manufacture of peat charcoal , that one cubic yard of the dug peat makes about 4 ^ cwt . of the dried material , and that 5 cwt . of charcoal are produced from 1 ton of the dried peat . As so much disagreement prevails with respect to the deodorizing power of peat charcoal , Mr . Blyth was instructed to make some experiments on the subject , and to determine the comparative value of peat charcoal and the ground Boghead coke for this purpose . I append Mr . Blyth\\'s report ( App.B . ) on this examination . The results obtained arc of considerable interest . It appears that neither of these substances has much deodorizing power when mixed with liquid . When heated after saturation they both gave off offensive effluvia in abundance , but , when spread over the surface of offensive matter , the escape of all odour was prevented . The experiments show that they have no power to separate matters from solution , and thus confirm the previous statements of Professor Way and Dr . Henderson that the power of charcoal to absorb ammonia from the atmosphere does not extend to the separation of that gas , or of anything worthy of notice , from solution . Then a distinctly wicked idea takes possession of the mind : \" What a divine—what a heavenly place to loot ! \" This gives place to a much worse devil—that of Conservatism . It seems not only a wrong but a criminal thing to allow natives to have any voice in the control of such a city—adorned , docked , wharfed , fronted , and reclaimed by Englishmen , existing only because England lives , and dependent for its life on England . All India knows of the Calcutta Municipality ; but has any one thoroughly investigated the Big Calcutta Stink ? There is only one . Benares is fouler in point of concentrated , pent-up muck , and there are local stenches in Peshawar which are stronger than the B . C . S . ; but , for diffused , soul-sickening expansiveness , the reek of Calcutta beats both Benares and Peshawar . Bombay cloaks her stenches with a veneer of assafœtida and tobacco ; Calcutta is above pretence . There is no tracing back the Calcutta plague to any one source . It is faint , it is sickly , and it is indescribable ; but Americans at the Great Eastern Hotel say that it is something like the smell of the Chinese quarter in San Francisco . It is certainly not an Indian smell . It resembles the essence of corruption that has rotted for the second time—the clammy odour of blue slime . And there is no escape from it . It blows across the maidan ; it comes in gusts into the corridors of the Great Eastern Hotel ; what they are pleased to call the \" Palaces of Chowringhi \" carry it ; it swirls round the Bengal Club ; it pours out of by-streets with sickening intensity , and the breeze of the morning is laden with it . It is first found , in spite of the fume of the engines , in Howrah Station . It seems to be worst in the little lanes at the back of Lai Bazar where the drinking-shops are , but it is nearly as bad opposite Government House and in the Public Offices . The thing is intermittent . Six moderately pure mouthfuls of air may be drawn without offence . Then comes the seventh wave and the queasiness of an uncultured stomach . If you live long enough in Calcutta you grow used to it . The regular residents admit the disgrace , but their answer is : \" Wait till the wind blows off the Salt Lakes where all the sewage goes , and then you\\'ll smell something . \" That is their defence ! Small wonder that they consider Calcutta is a fit place for a permanent Viceroy . Englishmen who can calmly extenuate one shame by another are capable of asking for anything—and expecting to get it . If an up-country station holding three thousand troops and twenty civilians owned such a possession as Calcutta does , the Deputy Commissioner or the Cantonment Magistrate would have all the natives off the board of management or decently shovelled into the background until the mess was abated . Then they might come on again and talk of \" high-handed oppression \" as much as they liked . That stink , to an unprejudiced nose , damns Calcutta as a City of Kings . And , in spite of that stink , they allow , they even encourage , natives to look after the place ! The damp , drainage-soaked soil is sick with the teeming life of a hundred years , and the Municipal Board list is choked with the names of natives—men of the breed born in and raised off this surfeited muck-heap ! They own property , these amiable Aryans on the Municipal and the Bengal Legislative Council . Launch a proposal to tax them on that property , and they naturally howl . They also howl up-country , but there the halls for mass-meetings are few , and the vernacular papers fewer , and with a strong Secretary and a President whose favour is worth the having and whose wrath is undesirable , men are kept clean despite themselves , and may not poison their neighbours . Why , asks a savage , let them vote at all ? They can put up with this filthiness . They cannot have any feelings worth caring a rush for . Let them live quietly and hide away their money under our protection , while we tax them till they know through their purses the measure of their neglect in the past , and when a little of the smell has been abolished , let us bring them back again to talk and take the credit of enlightenment . The better classes own their broughams and barouches ; the worse can shoulder an Englishman into the kennel and talk to him as though he were a cook . They can refer to an English lady as an aurat ; they are permitted a freedom—not to put it too coarsely—of speech which , if used by an Englishman toward an Englishman , would end in serious trouble . They are fenced and protected and made inviolate . Surely they might be content with all those things without entering into matters which they cannot , by the nature of their birth , understand . Now , whether all this genial diatribe be the outcome of an unbiassed mind or the result first of sickness caused by that ferocious stench , and secondly of headache due to day-long smoking to drown the stench , is an open question . Anyway , Calcutta is a fearsome place for a man not educated up to it . VPon the top of your glasse bodie , straine a haire cloth , and vpon that lay good store of Roseleaues , either drie , or halfe drie , and so your water will ascend verie good both in smell and in colour . Distill either in balneo , or in a gentle fire in ashes , you may rei ¦ terate the same water vppon fresh leaues . This may also be done in a leaden Still , ouer which by reason of the breadth you may place more leaues . 19 . An excellent wvy to make the extract of all Vegetables . EXpresse a good quantity of the iuice thereof , set it on the fire , and giue it onely a walme or two , then it will grow cleere : before it be cooled , pour away the cleerest , filter with a peece of cotton , and then euaporate your filtred iuyce , till it come to a thicke substance , and thus you shal haue a most excellent extracte of the Rose , Gilloflower , & c . with the perfect sent and taste of the flower , whereas the common waie is to make the extracte eyther by spirit of wine faire water , the water of the plant , or some kind of menstruum . 20 . To make a water smelling of the Eglantine , Gilloflowers , & c . DRie the hearbe or flower , and distill the same in faire water in a limbecke , draw no longer then you find sent in the water that issueth , reiterate that water vpon fresh herbes , and distil as before , diuiding the sweetest from the rest . 21 . A Scottish hand water . PVt thyme , Lauender , and Rosemary confusedly together , then make a lay of thicke wine Lees in the bottom of a stone pot , vppon which make an other laye of the said hearbes , & then a lay of Lees , and so forwarde , lute the pot wel , bury it in the ground for 6 . weeks distill it , & it is called Dames water in Scotland . A little therof put into a bason of a comon water ma ¦ keth very sweet washing water . 22 . How to draw the bloud of hearbes . STampe the hearb , put the same into a large glasse , leauing two parts emptie ( some commend the iuice of the hearbe onely ) nip or else lute the glasse very wel , digest it in balneo . 15 . or 16 . daies , and you shall finde the same very red , diuide the watrish part , and that which remaineth is the bloud or essence of the hearb . 23 . Rosewater , and yet the Roseleaues not discoloured . YOu must distill in balneo , and when the bottom of your pewter Still is through hotte , put in a fewe leaues at once and distill them : watch your Still carefully , and as soone as those are distilled put in more . I know not whether your profit will requite your labour , yet accept of it as a newe conclusion . 24 . How to recouer Rosewater , or any other distilled water that hath gotten a mother , and is in daunger to be musty . INfuse your water vpon fresh Rose leaues , or vpon Rose cakes broken all in peeces , and then after maceration for three or foure houres with a gentle fire , redistill your water . Do this in a Limbeck , take heed of drawing too long for burning , vnlesse your Limbecke stand in balneo . 25 . To drawe both good Rosewater , and oyle of Roses together . AFter you haue digested your Rose leaues by the speace of 3 . moneths , sicut ante , num . 13 . eyther in barrels or hookers , then distill the with faire water in a limbeck , draw so long as you finde anie excellent smell of the Rose , then diuide the fatty oile that fleeteth on the top of the Rose water , and so you haue both excellent oile of Roses , and also good Rosewater togither , and you shall also haue more water then by the ordinarie way , and this Rosewater extendeth farther in physicall compositions , and the other serueth best for perfumes and casting bottles . You may also distill the oyle of Linum Rhodtum this way , sauing that you shall not neede to macerate the same aboue 24 houres in your water or menstruum before you distill : this oyle hath a most pleasing smell in a manner equall with the oyle of Roses . Leaf Odours versus Floral Odours When we compare leaf odours with flower odours we find a considerable difference between them . Thus in the case of the orange there is a difference between the essential oils of the flowers and of the leaves , and of that of the rind of the fruit , which afford three different kinds of perfume . Then floral odours are generally positive , being exhaled by most flowers spontaneously as it were , so that you must inhale floral odours whether you like them or not . Leaf odours , on the other hand , are latent or negative , and are rarely to be detected except after the leaves have been touched , pressed , or bruised . Both leaf and flower perfume depends on the same essential oil being in different states or conditions . Floral odours again are emitted only at particular times , that is to say , just when the androecia ] whorl attains maturity , and the flowers are quite fresh ; and even then , in the case of many Orchids and other flowers , their scent is intermittent , and only to be perceived at different times of the day or night — this time , as we suppose , having some connection with the diurnal or nocturnal visits of the insects that act as marriage priests in their native wilds . But , on the other hand , leaf odours are persistent — ready if sought \" seems to be their motto — and not only are scented leaves fragrant when green and fresh , but often retain their perfume long after they are yellow or brown and sere . Mr Hudson , of Gunnersbury , to whom I am indebted for a collection of scented Pelargonia , tells me that the old yellow or brown leaves of these charming plants are sweeter even than the fresh ones . This is doubtless owing to the water of the leaves having evaporated , thus leaving behind the essential oils in a more concentrated form . This permanency of odour is a strong recommendation , and no greenhouse or conservatory or boudoir need be wanting in delicate perfume if plenty of sweet-leaved plants are grown . For as the Heathen Epictetus tels vs , wee try a man as wee try money . What figure or stampe hath this coine ? Traianes ? Then bring it . Neroes ? Away with is , it is adulterate , sophisticate , wicked . So is it in the tryall of a man . What figure and stampe doe his purposes and practises carry ? Is hee mercifull , meeke , humble , gentle , sociable , patient , a louer of all men ? Bring him , I allowe him , I admit him , and him onely for a man , and companion with God . But see hee haue not Neroes characters , or Nebuchadnezzars , or Ahabs , or Ieroboams . Is hee dissolute , riotous , vaine , luxarious an vncleane person ? Is he proud , haughty , high-minded ? Is hee angry ? Is hee a pursuer of enmities ? Is hee froward ? Doth hee reuenge himselfe of such as offend him , when hee gets opportunity ? Is hee an apparent impenitent wicked liuer in any grosse sinne ? What then ? Wilt thou say this is a man ? Surely no . Quiduis potius quàm homo ; He is rather any thing then a man : but a man hee is not . Wilt thou say , that all things are iudged of by their formes ? If that bee so , then thou mayest call a lumpe of waxe or clay an apple , because it is round like an apple : thou mayest say , it hath the smell and taste of an apple . But the outwarde circumscription and attendants are not sufficient ; it is not a nose , or an eye , or the like , that are sufficient to constitute a man : For humane purposes , and vertuous and noble actions , are required to make a man . This man heares not wholsome admonitions when he is reproued , he vnderstands not the things that belong to his peace , to his saluation : shall wee say he is a man , ? No , hee is an asse : his shamefastnesse and modesty is dead , hee is vnprofitable , hee is any thing rather then a man . Another there is , who seekes with whom hee may quarrell , whom hee may spurne and contemne . Therefore is neither a sheep nor an asse . What then ? Fera bestia , A wilde , bruite , sauage beast ? It is not then the shape & image of a man that makes a man , but the image of God in man , his vertuous inclinations , and resolute executions of good purposes . If he haue the stamp of vertue and holinesse , of mercy and goodnes , he is a man ; if not , he is so much lesse then a man , as a good man is more then a beast . If this were truely disgested , it would make thousands of such as onely carry the names and shapes of men , to be much ashamed of themselues . For what should make the profane and godlesse persons of the world , who will not be acquainted with goodnes at all , to blush , if this doe not ? That wheras they thinke themselues to bee the onely braue men of this world , they are in true account with God himselfe ) who is Optimus rerum aestimator , The best iudge of all things ) and also with all good men , esteemed as the dung of the streetes , and as salt that hath lost his saltnesse , which is good for nothing but to bee troden vnder foot . The Prodigall is a true embleme of a voluptuous , impenitent man , turned out of the nature of man into a swine and brute beast . For Christ tels vs , hee was set to feede swine . And to feede is vsually taken to recreate and delight : Oculos pictura pascit inani , Hee fed his eyes in beholding a vaine picture . So that to feede swine , is as much , as by the filthinesse of sinnes to delight and feed diuels : sinne beeing truely the diuels food : drunkennesse , vncleanesse , luxurie , and all other vices ( in the opinion of the learned ) no better but the diuells dainty dishes : All of vs so long feeding swine , as we doe by our sinnes please the diuell , or doe such things as the diuell reioiceth at . For as the meate of Christ is to doe his Fathers will , so it is the diuels meate , to doe his will . And therefore our Sauiour might well call the impenitent vicious vngodly man a swine , not fitte to haue pearles cast before him : for as from the swine comes no good , neither milke as from the cow , nor wooll as from the sheepe , nor faithfull seruice as from the dogge , nor obedience as from the horse , nor bearing of burdens as from the asse , nor tillage as from the oxe : as the swine giues no cotentment to him that feeds it , as the horse doth by his pace , the dogge by his hunting , the hawke by his fowling : so the voluptuous carnall man is good for nothing ; neyther hath God , who filles his bellie with his infinite treasures daily , any pleasure in him , or seruice from him . So that the wicked and vngodly sinner lying in his stinking pleasures , is truely a swine wallowing in the filthy puddle , as a filthy as aswine , as gluttonous as a swine , delighting in dirt as a swine , not smelling the stinke of his sin any more then the swine doth the stinke of the dirt it wallowes in . And yet no dung stinks so much in our nostrels , as sinne doth in the nostrels of God . And therefore the Scripture speaking of impenitent sinners , tels vs that the carcasse of Iezabel should be as dung on the ground ; and because they had sinned against the Lord , their flesh shall bee as the dung : the wicked becoming as the dung of the earth . Whereby we vnderstand , that no hot reeking dung , or filthy stinking carcasse cast out into the chanell , is so odious to our sight and smell , as the impenitent sinner is in the sight & nostrels of God and Angels . And so foule is the stinke of infull soules , as a godly Father obserues , that therefore Christ at the last iudgement shall shake them off with that irreuocable , depart from me , as not being able to endure their smell , no not so long as they shall bee a iudging . And as the vngodly are swine in these respects , so as Swine are choaked with the smell of roses , as they chew not their meate , as they are vnrofitable for all seruices , such are the voluptuous and carnall men for all the world ; to heare or see any good or godly thing doth choake them , they neuer ruminate and consider the Law of God , they are good for no worke of piety or religion , hauing no more Soule then swine haue .

And notwithstanding it happened to be a very wet afternoon , a great concourse of people for the second gallery attended . As soon as that part of the house was full , she disposed of the overflow in the boxes and up on the stage ; wisely preferring their two shillings a piece to empty benches . The heat of the house occasioned the wet clothes of the dripping audience to send forth odours not quite so sweet as those of Arabia . Not being accustomed to such effluvia , I gave preference to lavender water , with which I impregnated my handkerchief , and held it to my face . Mr Ross , who played Alexander , happened that night to be in one of his active dispositions , and intending to do the part justice , which was full in his power , when he did not chuse to walk over the course , he enquired why I hid my face from him whilst he was paying homage to my queenship . I as usual , played satire which I answered , that I did it because I was just suffocated with the stench ; the people smelling so of tripe that they were horrible offensive . The gentleman , out of humour at my delicacy put what I had uttered into his own tramontane language , and told the lovely Roxanna that I had said that her audience stunk . Enraged at so great a indignity thrown on such a a number of her worthy friends , who had endangered their lives , from being we to the skin in order to pay their respects to her , she formed a resolution to mortify me in my turn . ‘ On Affectation ’ , The Town and Country Magazine , Or Universal Repository of Knowledge , Instruction , and Entertainment , Volume 10 1778 , p . 197 I was the other evening at the rout of a lady of some consequence at the west end of the town , and during a party of quadrille , the conversation turned upon the company that were the night before at the opera . Lady Annabella S - declared that notwistanding all the encomiums that had been paid on the duchess of D - , she was a perfect fright . Heaves ! What a head ! Tittering all night with Colonel S - , and laughing out loud in the midst of some of the most favourite airs , yet she is pronounced a prodigy – she is indeed a prodify of coquetry and affectation ; for my part , Miss , ( addressing her next neighbour ) , I make it a rule positive at a public place , never to go beyond a simple . Well , but , said lady R - , how would you have been motified had you been seated as I was next to a packer ’ s wife from Thames-Street ? The odour of tar and pitch was so strong , that I had like to have fainted . I was obliged to keep my smelling bottle to mynose the whole night , and though it was the best eau de luce Warren sells , Mrs . L - was still far predominant . My dear lady , cried Miss V-n , your mortification was trivial to mine the other night in the front-box at Drury-lane . Down squatted alderman G - upon the same seat : I soon found from his conversation with his wife , that he had been at a city feast ; but he needed not to have confirmed it with his tongue , his cloaths sufficiently revealed it ; he smelt so insufferably of tobacco that I was obliged to withdraw before the end of the first act , or the consequences would have been fatal to me . In the case of Edgar there was a constitutional condition upon which was grafted a localized affection of the left lung . This was probably a lobar broncho-pneumonia in the first instance , like those just described , with pleurisy , the result of which was a cartilaginous degeneration of the pleura and a fibroid degeneration of the lung . We may look upon the fetid cavity , therefore , as consecutive to those fibroid degenerations , just as in ordinary phthisis a vomica is consecutive to tuberculization . And I think that when we find such cavities in a highly fibroid lung , we may reasonably conclude that they are formed like other ulcerous solutions of continuity of tissues in the state of fibroid degeneration , and are to he classed with rodent fibroid ulcers in the skin and cervix uteri or elsewhere . Hence the cavity is the result of rodent fibroid ulceration . In its lining pyogenic membrane there is a tissue analogous to that of the bronchial mucous membrane in cases of chronic bronchitis . Since the structural disease is constitutional , it is fair to conclude that the predisposing causes of the peculiar fetid excretion are constitutional , and are linked etiologically with the fibroid change of tissue . It is a special characteristic of fibroid and cartilaginous ulcerations to be fetid . This is well shown in ozaena , which is a deep ulceration of the fibrous and cartilaginous tissues of the nose , and also in rodent fibroid ulcers in general . The smell of ozaena is , in fact , very similar to that observed in examples of fetid fibroid vomicai ; and M . Lasagne correctly remarks the same of the fetor in fetid bronchitis . Yet it is not otherwise described by observers in general than as \" gangrenous . \" The characters will doubtless differ in different cases , according to the complications , — in one there may be dilated bronchi ; in another , a gangrenous cavern ; in another , blood may be exuded and decompose in tlie cavity under the same kind of fermentation as that which modifies the pus and bronchial secretion . The smell might well be termed an ozaena-odour . The Nature and Origin of the Pulmonary Fetor in Fetid Bronchitis and Bronchorrhoea . In the last group of cases I have endeavoured to show that the peculiar fetor is probably similar in origin to ozaena ; but it is not like that odour in all cases ; nor will the explanation apply to the fetor of acute and chronic bronchitis , or of bronchorrhoea , or broncho-pneumonia , for tliere is no proof of a rodent ulcerous cavity in these . Now , it is to be observed that the odour is sui generis in them , as compared with other pulmonary fetors , and has therefore its own characters . 1 . In its typical form , according to my experience , when it comes directly from the lung , it is always more or less faecal . In the first case that I observed , the breath and sputa rendered a spacious ward odious as a privy , with the stench of fresh foeces . As to this fact there can be no mistake . Now this is not the odour of the breath in cases of fetid abscess or ozaena . 2 . After the sputa has been exposed to the air for a while , however , it gives off an odour wholly different . In my first case I could only liken it to the delicate scent of a decaying apple . - In the case of Oliver S . ( reported by my friend Dr Low of King \\' s Lynn , together with my clinical remarks ) , the breath and sputa were noted as of an odour \" rather faecal than gangrenous ; \" while that of the sputa became like the scent of the apple or hawthorn blossom . And in the case of C . A . , the sputum is correctly described as \" of a muco-purulent character , with a disagreeable faecal odour , which is most intense when just expectorated , and which , on standing exposed to the air , becomes changed , — sometimes into a wet-mortar smell , but more generally into what simulates apple-blossom very closely . \" Now , in these characteristics the odour of fetid bronchitis differs essentially from that of fetid abscess and of true pulmonary gangrene . In the case of pulmonary gangi-ene with which I compared my first example of fetid bronchitis , the breath was so horrible that I was made sick to vomiting when using tlie stethoscope . It was wholly unlike that of faeces . All writers speak of this dreadful smeii in true pulmonary gangrene ; but none ever describe it as faecal except Louis . He informed M . Valleix that he had observed exceptions to this hon-ible putrid smell in certain cases , in which the odour resembled that of feces , although after death there was nothing more observed in the lung than what is usually found . I suspect , however , that these cases were examples of pyogenic cavities , or dilated bronchi , and not gangrene ; for it is probable these pyogenic membranes give forth the same purulent stuff as the bronchial mucous membrane in cases of fetid bronchitis . Dr EUiotson remarks incidentally , that in phthisis the expectoration sometimes smells \" like fasces . \" I must express a doubt , however , that these were cases of tubercular phthisis , for I have never observed the faecal odour in any such cases . Although fetid pus is not uncommon , pulmonary fetor , sui generis , is by no means a common symptom . I found it in only two of twelve hundred patients of the York County Hospital , and it can only be expected to occur in the rarer forms of consumption ( using the term in its general sense ) , such as the rheumatic consumption I have described , and the bronchial or \" pituitous consumption \" of Gilchrist , in which there is a copious purulent expectoration derived solely from the smaller bronchi , although the lungs themselves are flabby , or emphysematous , or cedematous . It follows , from these facts , that there are three distinct kinds of pulmonary fetor , namely , that of faces , that of ozaena , and that of gangrene ; and it remains to ascertain how each arises . The odour of pulmonary gangrene is obviously due to putrescent decomposition of the dead pulmonary tissue ; it is the odour of putrefaction . Dr Law has expressed the opinion that the blood previously effused into the lung putrefies . This may be the case when the lung itself is gangrenous , but blood rarely thus putrefies per se — perhaps never — without the action of a septic \" ferment . \" It is well known that putrid meat will quickly induce putrescence in fresh meat when brought near to it or in contact with it ; and it is therefore conceivable that the effused blood in cases of pneumonia and pulmonary apoplexy of a low type may receive a septic \" ferment \" from without , and thus the putrid fermentation be set up in it . Or it is possible that some of the infusorial organisms wiiich seem to be associated with hospital gangrene and other kinds of infectious putrescence may take effect on the blood or pulmonary tissue . In pulmonary mouldiness ( the pneumono-mycosis of Vircliow ) a parasitic bronchitis seems to result from the irritation of an aspergillus in the bronchi . These have been found also surrounding the margin of a gangrenous cavity in the lung . The pulmonary moulds are not unknown to phthisis , and it seems probable that the sporules may multiply in the bronchi , and be diffused by the breath of the patient , so as to excite a bronchitis in those persons who inhale them who have weak lungs . Hence , perhaps , the widespread belief , that it is not safe to sleep with a phthisical person , and that phthisis is a dangerously infectious complaint , as is the opinion in Italy . The putrescent infusoria , such as the vibrios of hospital gangrene and the bacterides of carbuncular gangrene , have not , I think , been looked for in cases of pulmonary gangrene . The bacterides may , however , be a cause of those kinds in wliich the gangrenous cavity has no contact with the external air and there is no fetor , inasmuch as they are abundantly present in the blood in carbuncular gangrene , and which sometimes affects the lungs . Since Laennec first mooted the opinion , the ozena-odour in certain forms of bronchorrhoea and bronchitis has been attributed by several observers to a putrescence of the bronchial excretions . Granting this , the inquiry naturally follows , why they become putrescent in tlie particular class of cases described , amongst the many thousands who suffer from puralent bronchial secretion ? Besides , the odour evolved is not at all like that of the fetid pus expectorated in cases of empyema , in which the cavity communicates with a bronchus , so that if the purulent bronchial excretion do undergo change , there must be something in its composition in these cases of a special character . That it does undergo decomposition seems certain ; but it does not follow that the change is putrefaction . In ozaena from ulceration of the nasal cartilages , and in rodent fibroid ulcers , there is a most offensive discharge , but the odour is not like the smell of decomposing pus from ordinary ulcers . The pus of fibroid pyogenic cavities and of fetid bronchitis undergoes a similar change . We are therefore led to the conclusion that in all these cases there is some special constituent of the morbid products which either undergoes its own peculiar decomposition or acts as a ferment in exciting such in the other constituents . I do not think we need go beyond observed facts for instances as to this point . In so far as anatomical changes have been observed in these fetid pulmonary diseases , they are manifestly those of fibrinous exudation and degeneration , — are , in short , those which are observed in acute and chronic tissue-changes of rheumatic origin . Now , we know that in such changes lactic acid plays an important part , either as a cause if we adopt the conclusions of Dr B . W . Richardson and others , or as a result of the morbid tissue-metamorphosis , if the ordinary theory be objected to . And it seems farther probable , according to the physiological chemists , that it is decomposed in the lungs , under ordinary circumstances , into carbonic acid and water . If , then , we suppose that there is an excess of lactic acid in the pulmonary excretions in these cases , or of some other acid of the class , or that the ordinary series of decompositions is interrupted and other products result in virtue of vital changes , an irritant is brought into direct contact with the bronchial mucous membrane . If this be sufficiently powerful , the same consequences will follow as with other powerful irritants ( such as the vapours of iodine or chlorine ) , and tlius a bronchitis with a copious muco-purulent discharge be excited . How easily lactic acid or acids or the lactates may be transformed within the capillary bronchi and air-cells , or elsewhere , wherever a suitable ferment is introduced or produced , is shown by the fact that when lactates are left in contact with putrefying matter , at a temperature of 86 ° to 95 ° , butyric acid is formed . That a rheumatic condition is an important element in these cases is shown by collateral evidence , although the morbid product need not necessarily be lactic acid , and certainly is not in all cases of pulmonary fetor . It is incidentally mentioned that in Dr Haldane \\' s case tube-casts of the smaller bronchi were at first mistaken for disintegrating lung-tissue . Now these cases of \" plastic bronchitis \" run a course almost identical with that of cases of fetid bronchopneumonia . There is the same frequency of haemorrhage , violent cough , and other important symptoms , occun-ing in paroxysms , lasting for a week or two , but sometimes for several weeks , with the same tendency to recur for weeks or years . They also end in a very similar manner , either in a form of phthisis or in a dangerous pulmonary complication , and they are about equally rare . In short , substitute for expectoration of plastic tube-casts a fetid mucopurulent expectoration , and the diseases would be identical , — so that the constitutional conditions are apparently the same . The difiference is as to the susceptibility of the morbid pulmonary excretions and exudations to undergo decomposition . These cases of plastic bronchitis shade off also into that special kind of lobar bronchopneumonia , closely resembling the fetid kind in symptoms and course , and occurring in rheumatic subjects , to wliicli I liave already referred . A case of this kind is now under my care in the Infirmary , in which the seat of lesion is ( as is most common ) in the left lung , with persistent pain there , and tingling in the palm of the left hand . The patient ( a man ) has had profuse stronglysmelling sweats , like those of the . rheumatic , and rheumatic corpuscles in his urine . Fetor of the breath closely resembling that under consideration is observed in pregnancy , scorbutus , and cachectic states of a rheumatic character ; in all these the blood is highly fibrinous and embolism not uncommon . Since the pulmonary artery has been found plugged in cases of pulmonary gangrene and rodent pulmonary ulcer simulating it , tlie plugging has been usually considered as the cause of the morbid change . There seems to be , however , just as solid ground for the opposite theory , namely , that the plugging is caused by the pulmonary disease . But , however caused , the excess of fibrin is probably a predisposing or exciting cause of the fetor . These remarks refer chiefly to cases of pulmonary fetor in which changes of structure have been observed . But in one class of these affections there is no cognisable disease , and yet a very characteristic odour ( the faecal ) is exhaled . But these cases , when examined , only serve to show more clearly its rheumatic origin . In offensive perspiration of the feet a peculiar cabbage-like stench is given off . It has been roundly asserted that this is due simply to want of cleanliness , just as the stench of fetid bronchitis has been attributed to gangrene ; but the theory is certainly not sound . Cases occur in which the most scrupulous cleanliness fails to prevent the smell . Indeed , I know no more intractable malady , for even when the stockings and shoes are changed two or three times a-day and powerful scents used , the morbid stench is still diffused . It seems probable that the perspiration contains an element which undergoes decomposition at a low temperature or on exposure to the air . I have been informed that a surgeon in extensive practice in the north of England committed suicide a few years ago because of this offensive malady . A patient soon infects the air of a large room . In the cases that have come under my observation I could trace distinctly a rheumatic habit , and sometimes rheumatism was a complication . Allied to this is the offensive odour in some forms of rheumatic fever and in cases of acute recuiTcnt attacks of leprous inflammation of the skin , in which the paroxysm terminates by a copious plastic exudation into the cutaneous cellular tissue . The urine sometimes becomes fetid in like manner . Dr Low , of King \\' s Lynn , had communicated to me the particulars of a case of this kind in a pregnant female , and which ceased with delivery . Speculations have naturally arisen as to the immediate origin and composition of the volatile matter which causes the stench ; and as the blood is easily impregnated with volatile stuff , it is readily concluded that it comes from the blood . Perhaps it may be so as to some ; but I think it equally probable as to others , that they first become what we find them on exposure to the air in the lungs at a blood-heat , or on the surface of the body , as in cases of fetid perspiration . The change in smell which the fetid sputa undergo on exposure to the air shows how easily decomposition takes place . Possibly the faecal odour may be an excretion , but if it were so in my first observed case , it did not originate in any so-called metastasis , for I noted the state of the faeces as to odour and observed no change . Pus from abscesses in the abdominal parietes has been found to be highly faecal in smell , although the most careful examination failed to detect any connexion between the abscess and the intestines . I have no doubt that sulphur is a predominant , albeit not exclusive constituent of these fetid volatile changes . The odour itself is a sufficient proof , independently of distillations of sputa at a temperature of 230 ° Fahr . ; and I may add that ordinary pulmonary vapour itself , if collected and kept a while , quickly becomes fetid , and even the condensed vapours on the windows of rooms crowded with people smells offensively although the highest temperature cannot exceed 90 ° . Dr Gamgee has , however , demonstrated , what was already plain enough to all acquainted with the facts , that we can get stinks from any pulmonary excretion whatever , if we subject them to the same chemical torments of distillation , acidification , neutralization , redistillation , and the like . This fact is no ground , however , for the conclusions , that there is nothing special in the odour of fetid bronchitis or its causes , and that we must abandon that term as perplexing , unscientific , and unphilosophical , for the more correct phrase \" bronchitis with fetid expectoration . \" I have , however , subjoined reports of the chemical analysis of the sputum in two cases under my care . Irishmen who do me the honour of tasting this light omelette of scientific literature will have noticed , I am sure , that I have not included the sister isle in my olfactory paradise . And indeed , I hesitated long before passing it over , because I am a man of peace—at any price where the Land of Ire is concerned . But alas ! I am by nature truthful and only by art mendacious . And there sticks horrible to my memory the fumous and steamy stench of parboiled cabbage that filled the restaurant-car of the train for Belfast—yes ! Belfast , not Dublin—one evening as I landed at Kingstown . The sea had been—well ! it was the Irish Sea , and I stepped on to the train straight from the mail-boat , so that . . . in a word , I remember that luscious but washy odour too vividly to bestow upon Ireland the white flower of a stenchless life . In these remarks I have been careful to observe that the train was not the Dublin train , but if any one feels moved to defend the capital city , let him first of all take a stroll down by the Liffey as it flows fermenting and bubbling under its bridges , and then . . . if he can . . . . Let me , however , in justice to that grief-stricken country , spray a little perfume over my too pungent observations . I can also recall after many years a warm and balmy evening in the town of Killarney , the peaceful close to a day of torrential rain . The setting sun , glowing love through its tears , was reddening the sky and the dark green hills around , those hills of Ireland where surely , if anywhere on this earth , heaven is foreshadowed . And linked in memory with that evening ’ s glory there comes , like the gentle strain of a long-forgotten song , the rich , pungent smell of turf-smoke eddying blue from low chimneys into the soft air of the twilight . Ireland ! Ireland ! What an atmosphere of love and grief that name calls up ! Surely the surf that beats upon the strands of Innisfail far away is more salt , more bitter , and perhaps for that very reason more sweet , than the waters of any of the other beaches that ocean bathes ! Thence also comes a memory of heliotrope . It grew by a cottage just beyond a grey granite fishing-harbour in Dublin Bay , and brings also , with its faint , ineffable fragrance , the same inseparable blending of emotions that clings , itself a never-dying odour , to the memory of holidays 5in Ireland . There is a phrase in a song , simple , sentimental , even silly if you like , that prays for “ the peace of mind dearer than all . ” “ But what , ” I remember asking the mother of our party — “ what is meant by ‘ peace of mind ’ ? ” Her wistful smile seemed to me to be a very inadequate reply to my question—which , by the way , I am still asking . It is an historical fact that the movement which rendered England the pioneer country in the matter of Public Health received its first impulse from , and even now owes its continued existence to , the simple accident that the English public has grown intolerant of over-obtrusive odours . Stenches have attained to the dignity of a legal topic of interest , and are now by Act of Parliament become “ nuisances ” in law as well as in nature , with the result that they have been , for the most part , banished from the face of the land and the noses of its inhabitants . The reason assigned by the man in the street for this reform was , and indeed still is , that stenches breed epidemic diseases . In a noisome smell people imagine a deadly pestilence , probably because patients affected with such epidemic diseases as smallpox , typhus , and diphtheria , give off nauseating odours . Now , bad smells from drains and cesspools do not of themselves induce 6epidemic disease . Nevertheless , there is this much of truth in the superstition , that where you have bad smells you have also surface accumulations of filth , and these , soaking through soil and subsoil , contaminate surface wells , until it only requires the advent of a typhoid or other “ carrier ” to set a widespread epidemic a-going . Further , as recent investigators have shown us , the loathsome and deadly typhus fever , known for years to be a “ filth-disease , ” is carried by lice , which pests breed and flourish where bodily cleanliness is neglected and personal odours are strong . So that in this , as in most superstitions , there is a substratum of truth . But the point is , that the objection to bad smells preceded all those scientific discoveries and had , in the beginning , but a slender support from rationalism . Our forebears builded better than they knew . Their objection was in reality intuitive . It may be true that all nations occupying a corresponding level of civilisation will manifest the same instinctive abhorrences , but it has been left to the practical genius of the English race to give effect to the natural repugnance and to translate its urgings into practice . The interesting question now arises : How and when did this intuition or instinct , this blind feeling , arise , and what transformed it from a mere individual objection , voiced here and there , to a mass-movement leading to a general popular reformation ? The first explanation that is likely to occur to us is , that it was due to the refinement of feeling that accompanies high civilisation operating in a community quick to respond and to react when a public benefit is anticipated . One of the results of culture is an increase in the delicacy of the senses . When men and women strive after refinement , they achieve it , becoming refined , in spite of what pessimists and so-called realists preach , not only in their outward behaviour , but also in their innermost thoughts and feelings , and this internal refinement implies among other things a quickening of the sense of disgust . There is naturally a close and intimate connection between the sense of smell and the nerve-centres which , when stimulated , evoke the feeling of nausea in the mind—and the bodily acts that follow it . We are here dealing , in fact , with a primitive protective impulse to ensure that evil-smelling things shall not be swallowed , and the means adopted by Nature to prevent that ingestion , or , if it has accidentally occurred , to reverse it , are prompt . And successful . There is no compromise with the evil thing . Like all other nerve-reactions , this particular reflex can be educated : either up or down . It can be blunted and degraded , or it can be rendered 8more acute , more prompt to react . Now , one of the effects of civilised life , of town life , is to abbreviate the period of all reflex action . And if this applies to knee-jerks and to seeing jokes , it is even more noticeable in the particular reflex we are here considering . A citizen of Cologne in Coleridge ’ s days , for example , must have been anosmic to most of the seven-and-twenty stenches that offended the Englishman , and in my own time I have counted as many as ten objectionable public perfumes , yea ! even in Lucerne , the “ Lovely Lucerne ” of the railway posters . Several of these , perhaps , did not amount to more than a mere whiff , just the suspicion of a something unpleasant , no more ( but no less ) disturbing than , say , one note a semitone flat in a major chord ; two or three of them , however , to the sensitive , thin-winged organ of an English school-ma ’ am , would have attained to the rank of a “ smell , ” a word on her lips as emphatic as an oath on yours or mine ; four of them , at the least , were plain stenches , and so beyond her vocabulary altogether ; and one was—well ! beyond even mine , but only too eloquent itself of something ugly and bloated , some mess becoming aerial just round the corner . I did not turn that corner . Now , the people of Lucerne could never have smelled them , or at all events they could never 9have appreciated those perfumes as I did , or the town would have been evacuated . Their olfactory sense compared with mine must have been a stupid thing , dense to begin with , and cudgelled by use and wont into blank insensibility . Because , it is obvious , delicacy in this , as in all the senses , can only be acquired by avoiding habitual overstimulation . And that avoidance is only possible in a country where odours are fine , etherealised , rare . Even in France , France the enlightened , the sensitive , the refined , primitive odours pervade the country , as our Army knows very well . Not only is the farm dunghill given place of honour in the farm courtyard , close to doors and windows , but even in the mansions of the wealthy the cesspool still remains—not outside , but inside , the house , the water-carriage system , even the pail-system ( if that can be called a system ) , being unknown . So that our Army authorities had to send round a peculiar petrol-engine , known to the Tommies as “ Stinking Willie , ” to empty those pools of corruption . Some of the monasteries used by us as hospitals were , at the beginning of the war , even worse . From this we may surmise that the olfactory sense of our neighbours is not yet so sensitive as is ours . But in this matter Western Europe , at its worst—say , in one of the corridor-trains to Marseilles—is a mountain-top to a pigstye compared with the old and gorgeous East . “ The East , ” ejaculated an old Scotsman once — “ the East is just a smell ! It begins at Port Said and disna stop till ye come to San Francisco , . . . if there ! ” he added after a pause . From his sweeping condemnation we must , however , exempt Japan . Who can ever forget the bazaar smells of India , the mingled must and fust with its background of garlic and strange vices , or the still more mysterious atmospheres of China with their deep suggestion of musk ? Naturally the air of a cold country is clearer of obnoxious vapours than that of tropical and subtropical climes , but in spite of that , the first whiff of a Tibetan monastery , like that of an Eskimo hut , grips the throat , they say , like the air over a brewing vat . So that , after making every allowance for the favour of Nature , we are still entitled to claim that the relative purity of England , and of English cities , towns and even villages , is an artificial achievement . I may therefore , with justice , raise a song of praise to our fathers who have had our country thus swept and garnished , swept of noxious vapours and emanations , and garnished with the perfume of pure and fresh air , to the delight and invigoration of our souls . And yet the change has only recently been brought about . Up to the beginning of the nineteenth century the city of London “ was certainly as foul as could be . The streets were unpaved or paved only with rough cobble stones . There were no side walks . The houses projected over the roadway , and were unprovided with rain-water gutters , and during a shower rain fell from the roofs into the middle of the street . These streets were filthy from constant contributions of slops and ordure from animals and human beings . There were no underground drains , and the soil of the town was soaked with the filth of centuries . This sodden condition of the soil must have affected the wells to a greater or less extent . ” ( “ London , Sanitary and Medical , ” by G . V . Poore . 1889 . ) VIII THERE IS A QUALITY OR VIRTUE IN BODIES , WHICH WE CALL THEIR SMELL . HOW THIS IS CONNECTED IN THE IMAGINATION WITH THE SENSATION We have considered smell as signifying a sensation , feeling , or impression upon the mind , and in this sense , it can only be in a mind , or sentient being : but it is evident , that mankind give the name of smell much more frequently to something which they conceive to be external , and to be a quality of body ; they understand something by it which does not at all infer a mind , and have not the least difficulty in conceiving the air perfumed with aromatic odours in the deserts of Arabia , or in some uninhabited island where the human foot never trod . Every sensible day-labourer hath as clear a notion of this , and as full a conviction of the possibility of it , as he hath of his own existence ; and can no more doubt of the one than of the other . Suppose that such a man meets with a modern philosopher , and wants to be informed , what smell in plants is . The philosopher tells him , that there is no smell in plants , nor in any thing but in the mind : that it is impossible there can be smell but in a mind ; and that all this hath been demonstrated by modern philosophy . The plain man will , no doubt , be apt to think him merry : but if he finds that he is serious , his next conclusion will be , that he is mad ; or that philosophy , like magic , puts men into a new world , and gives them different faculties from common men . And thus philosophy and common sense are set at variance . But who is to blame for it ? In my opinion the philosopher is to blame . For if he means by smell what the rest of mankind most commonly mean , he is certainly mad . But if he puts a different meaning upon the word , without observing it himself , or giving warning to others , he abuses language , and disgraces philosophy , without doing any service to truth : as if a man should exchange the meaning of the words daughter and cow , and then endeavour to prove to his plain neighbour , that his cow is his daughter , and his daughter his cow . I believe there is not much more wisdom in many of those paradoxes of the ideal philosophy , which to plain sensible men appear to be palpable absurdities , but with the adepts pass for profound discoveries . I resolve , for my own part , always to pay a great regard to the dictates of common sense , and not to depart from them without absolute necessity ; and therefore I am apt to think , that there is really something in the rose or lily , which is by the vulgar called smell , and which continues to exist when it is not smelled : and shall proceed to inquire what this is ; how we come by the notion of it ; and what relation this quality or virtue of smell hath to the sensation , which we have been obliged to call by the same name , for want of another . Let us therefore suppose , as before , a person to exercise the sense of smelling : a little experience will discover to him , that the nose is the organ of this sense , and that the air , or something in the air , is a medium of it . And finding by further experience , that when a rose is near , he has a certain sensation ; when it is removed , the sensation is gone ; he finds a connection in nature betwixt the rose and this sensation . The rose is considered as a cause , occasion , or antecedent , of the sensation ; the sensation as an effect or consequent of the presence of the rose : they are associated in the mind , and constantly found conjoined in the imagination . But here it deserves our notice , that although the sensation may seem more closely related to the mind its subject , or to the nose its organ ; yet neither of these connections operate so powerfully upon the imagination , as its connection with the rose its concomitant . The reason of this seems to be , that its connection with the mind is more general , and no way distinguisheth it from other smells , or even from tastes , sounds , and other kinds of sensations . The relation it hath to the organ , is likewise general , and doth not distinguish it from other smells ; but the connection it hath with the rose is special , and constant : by which means they become almost inseparable in the imagination ; in like manner as thunder and lightning , freezing and cold . SECTION IX THAT THERE IS A PRINCIPLE IN HUMAN NATURE , FROM WHICH THE NOTION OF THIS , AS WELL AS ALL OTHER NATURAL VIRTUES OR CAUSES , IS DERIVED In order to illustrate further how we come to conceive a quality or virtue in the rose which we call smell , and what this smell is , it is proper to observe , that the mind begins very early to thirst after principles , which may direct it in the exertion of its powers . The smell of a rose is a certain aff ection or feeling of the mind ; and as it is not constant , but comes and goes , we want to know when and where we may expect it , and are uneasy till we find something , which being present , brings this feeling along with it , and being removed , removes it . This , when found , we call the cause of it ; not a strict and philosophical sense , as if the feeling were really effected or produced by that cause , but in a popular sense : for the mind is satisfied , if there is a constant conjunction between them ; and such causes are in reality nothing else but laws of nature . Having found the smell thus constantly conjoined with the rose , the mind is at rest , without inquiring whether this conjunction is owing to a real efficiency or not ; that being a philosophical inquiry , which does not concern human life . \" Yea , verily . \" \" So do I . I was converted by six weeks \\' debauchery . \" The minister started . \" Young man , \" he said , solemnly , going up close to Felix and laying a hand on his shoulder , \" speak not lightly of the [ 57 ] Divine operations , and restrain unseemly words . \" \" I \\' m not speaking lightly , \" said Felix . \" If I had not seen that I was making a hog of myself very fast , and that pig-wash , even if I could have got plenty of it , was a poor sort of thing , I should never have looked life fairly in the face to see what was to be done with it . I laughed out loud at last to think that a poor devil like me , in a Scotch garret , with my stockings out at heel and a shilling or two to be dissipated upon , with a smell of raw haggis mounting from below , and old women breathing gin as they passed me on the stairs—wanting to turn my life into easy pleasure . Then I began to see what else it could be turned into . Not much , perhaps . This world is not a very fine place for a good many of the people in it . But I \\' ve made up my mind it shan \\' t be the worse for me , if I can help it . They may tell me I can \\' t alter the world—that there must be a certain number of sneaks and robbers in it , and if I don \\' t lie and filch somebody else will . Well then , somebody else shall , for I won \\' t . That \\' s the upshot of my conversion , Mr . Lyon , if you want to know it . \" Mr . Lyon removed his hand from Felix \\' s shoulder and walked about again . \" Did you sit under any preacher at Glasgow , young man ? \" \" No : I heard most of the preachers once , but I never wanted to hear them twice . \" The good Rufus was not without a slight rising of resentment at this young man \\' s want of reverence . It was not yet plain whether he wanted to hear twice the preacher in Malthouse Yard . But the resentful feeling was carefully repressed : a soul in so peculiar a condition must be dealt with delicately . \" And now , may I ask , \" he said , \" what course you mean to take , after hindering your mother from making and selling these drugs ? I speak no more in their favor after what you have said . God forbid that I should strive to hinder you from seeking whatsoever things are honest and honorable . But your mother is advanced in years ; she needs comfortable sustenance ; you have doubtless considered how you may make her amends ? \\' He that provideth not for his own — — \\' I trust you respect the authority that so speaks . And I will not suppose that , after being tender of conscience toward strangers , you will be careless toward your mother . There be indeed some who , taking a mighty charge on their [ 58 ] shoulder , must perforce leave their households to Providence , and to the care of humbler brethren , but in such a case the call must be clear . \" \" I shall keep my mother as well—nay , better—than she has kept herself . She has always been frugal . With my watch and clock cleaning , and teaching one or two little chaps that I \\' ve got to come to me , I can earn enough . As for me , I can live on bran porridge . I have the stomach of a rhinoceros . \" \" But for a young man so well furnished as you , who can questionless write a good hand and keep books , were it not well to seek some higher situation as clerk or assistant ? I could speak to Brother Muscat , who is well acquainted with all such openings . Any place in Pendrell \\' s Bank , I fear , is now closed against such as are not Churchmen . It used not to be so , but a year ago he discharged Brother Bodkin , although he was a valuable servant . Still , something might be found . There are ranks and degrees—and those who can serve in the higher must not unadvisedly change what seems to be a providential appointment . Your poor mother is not altogether — — \" \" Excuse me , Mr . Lyon ; I \\' ve had all that out with my mother , and I may as well save you any trouble by telling you that my mind has been made up about that a long while ago . I \\' ll take no employment that obliges me to prop up my chin with a high cravat , and wear straps , and pass the livelong day with a set of fellows who spend their spare money on shirt pins . That sort of work is really lower than many handicrafts ; it only happens to be paid out of proportion . That \\' s why I set myself to learn the watchmaking trade . My father was a weaver first of all . It would have been better for him if he had remained a weaver . I came home through Lancashire and saw an uncle of mine who is a weaver still . I mean to stick to the class I belong to—people who don \\' t follow the fashions . \" Mr . Lyon was silent a few moments . This dialogue was far from plain sailing ; he was not certain of his latitude and longitude . If the despiser of Glasgow preachers had been arguing in favor of gin and Sabbath-breaking , Mr . Lyon \\' s course would have been clearer . \" Well , well , \" he said , deliberately , \" it is true that St . Paul exercised the trade of tent-making , though he was learned in all the wisdom of the Rabbis . \" \" St . Paul was a wise man , \" said Felix . \" Why should I want to get into the middle class because I have some learning ? The most of the middle class are as ignorant as the working people about everything that [ 59 ] doesn \\' t belong to their own Brummagem life . That \\' s how the workingmen are left to foolish devices and keep worsening themselves : the best heads among them forsake their boon comrades , and go in for a house with a high door-step and a brass knocker . \" Mr . Lyon stroked his mouth and chin , perhaps because he felt some disposition to smile ; and it would not be well to smile too readily at what seemed but a weedy resemblance of Christian unworldliness . On the contrary , there might be a dangerous snare in an unsanctified outstepping of average Christian practice . \" Nevertheless , \" he observed , gravely , \" it is by such self-advancement that many have been enabled to do good service to the cause of liberty and to the public well-being . The ring and the robe of Joseph were no objects for a good man \\' s ambition , but they were the signs of that credit which he won by his divinely-inspired skill , and which enabled him to act as a saviour to his brethren . \" \" Oh , yes , your ringed and scented men of the people ! — I won \\' t be one of them . Let a man once throttle himself with a satin stock , and he \\' ll get new wants and new motives . Metamorphosis will have begun at his neck-joint , and it will go on till it has changed his likings first and then his reasoning , which will follow his likings as the feet of a hungry dog follow his nose . I \\' ll have none of your clerkly gentility . I might end by collecting greasy pence from poor men to buy myself a fine coat and a glutton \\' s dinner , on pretence of serving the poor men . I \\' d sooner be Paley \\' s fat pigeon than a demagogue all tongue and stomach , though \" — here Felix changed his voice a little — \" I should like well enough to be another sort of demagogue , if I could . \" \" Then you have a strong interest in the great political movements of these times ? \" said Mr . Lyon , with a perceptible flashing of the eyes . \" I should think so . I despise every man who has not—or , having it , doesn \\' t try to rouse it in other men . \" \" Right , my young friend , right , \" said the minister , in a deep cordial tone . Inevitably his mind was drawn aside from the immediate consideration of Felix Holt \\' s spiritual interest by the prospect of political sympathy . In those days so many instruments of God \\' s cause in the fight for religious and political liberty held creeds that were painfully wrong , and , indeed , irreconcilable with salvation ! \" That is my own view , which I maintain in the face of some opposition from [ 60 ] brethren who contend that a share in public movements is a hindrance to the closer walk , and that the pulpit is no place for teaching men their duties as members of the commonwealth . I have had much puerile blame cast upon me because I have uttered such names as Brougham and Wellington in the pulpit . Why not Wellington as well as Rabshakeh ? and why not Brougham as well as Balaam ? Does God know less of men than He did in the days of Hezekiah and Moses ? — is His arm shortened , and is the world become too wide for His providence ? But , they say , there are no politics in the New Testament — — \" \" Well , they \\' re right enough there , \" said Felix , with his usual unceremoniousness . \" What ! you are of those who hold that a Christian minister should not meddle with public matters in the pulpit ? \" said Mr . Lyon , coloring . \" I am ready to join issue on that point . \" \" Not I , sir , \" said Felix ; \" I should say , teach any truth you can , whether it \\' s in the Testament or out of it . It \\' s little enough anybody can get hold of , and still less what he can drive into the skulls of a pence-counting , parcel-tying generation , such as mostly fill your chapels . \" \" Young man , \" said Mr . Lyon , pausing in front of Felix . He spoke rapidly , as he always did , except when his words were specially weighted with emotion : he overflowed with matter , and in his mind matter was always completely organized into words . \" I speak not on my own behalf , for not only have I no desire that any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be , but I am aware of much that should make me patient under a disesteem resting even on too hasty a construction . I speak not as claiming reverence for my own age and office—not to shame you , but to warn you . It is good that you should use plainness of speech , and I am not of those who would enforce a submissive silence on the young , that they themselves , being elders , may be heard at large ; but Elihu was the youngest of Job \\' s friends , yet was there a wise rebuke in his words ; and the aged Eli was taught by a revelation to the boy Samuel . I have to keep a special watch over myself in this matter , inasmuch as I have need of utterance which makes the thought within me seem as a pent-up fire , until I have shot it forth , as it were , in arrowy words , each one hitting its mark . Therefore I pray for a listening spirit , which is a great mark of grace . Nevertheless , my young friend , I am bound , as I [ 61 ] said , to warn you . The temptations that most beset those who have great natural gifts , and are wise after the flesh , are pride and scorn , more particularly toward those weak things of the world which have been chosen to confound the things which are mighty . The scornful nostril and the high head gather not the odors that lie on the track of truth . The mind that is too ready at contempt and reprobation is — — \" Here the door opened , and Mr . Lyon paused to look around , but seeing only Lyddy with the tea-tray , he went on — \" Is , I may say , as a clenched fist that can give blows , but is shut up from receiving and holding aught that is precious—though it were heaven-sent manna . \" \" I understand you , sir , \" said Felix , good-humoredly , putting out his hand to the little man , who had come close to him as he delivered the last sentence with sudden emphasis and slowness . \" But I \\' m not inclined to clench my fist at you . \" \" Well , well , \" said Mr . Lyon , shaking the proffered hand , \" we shall see more of each other , and I trust shall have much profitable communing . You will stay and have a dish of tea with us : we take the meal late on Thursdays , because my daughter is detained by giving a lesson in the French tongue . But she is doubtless returned now , and will presently come and pour out tea for us . \" \" Thank you , I \\' ll stay , \" said Felix , not from any curiosity to see the minister \\' s daughter , but from a liking for the society of the minister himself—for his quaint looks and ways , and the transparency of his talk , which gave a charm even to his weakness . The daughter was probably some prim Miss , neat , sensible , pious , but all in a small feminine way , in which Felix was no more interested than in Dorcas meetings , biographies of devout women , and that amount of ornamental knitting which was not inconsistent with Non-conforming seriousness . \" I \\' m perhaps a little too fond of banging and smashing , \" he went on : \" a phrenologist at Glasgow told me I had large veneration ; another man there , who knew me , laughed out and said I was the most blasphemous iconoclast living . \\' That , \\' says my phrenologist , \\' is because of his large ideality , which prevents him from finding anything perfect enough to be venerated . \\' Of course I put my ears down and wagged my tail at that stroking . \" \" Yes , yes ; I have had my own head explored with somewhat similar results . It is , I fear , but a vain show of fulfilling the heathen precept , \\' Know thyself , \\' and too often leads to a self-estimate which will subsist in the absence of that fruit by which alone the quality [ 62 ] of the tree is made evident . Nevertheless — — Esther , my dear , this is Mr . Holt , whose acquaintance I have now been making with more than ordinary interest . He will take tea with us . \" Esther bowed slightly as she walked across the room to fetch the candle and place it near her tray . Felix rose and bowed , also with an air of indifference , which was perhaps exaggerated by the fact that he was inwardly surprised . The minister \\' s daughter was not the sort of person he expected . She was quite incongruous with his notion of ministers \\' daughters in general ; and though he had expected something nowise delightful , the incongruity repelled him . A very delicate scent , the faint suggestion of a garden , was wafted as she went . He would not observe her , but he had a sense of an elastic walk , the tread of small feet , a long neck and a high crown of shining brown plaits and curls that floated backward—things , in short , that suggested a fine lady to him , and determined him to notice her as little as possible . A fine lady was always a sort of spun-glass affair—not natural , and with no beauty for him as art ; but a fine lady as the daughter of this rusty old Puritan was especially offensive . \" Nevertheless , \" continued Mr . Lyon , who rarely let drop any thread of discourse , \" that phrenological science is not irreconcilable with the revealed dispensations . And it is undeniable that we have our varying native dispositions which even grace will not obliterate . I myself , from my youth up , have been given to question too curiously concerning the truth—to examine and sift the medicine of the soul rather than to apply it . \" \" If your truth happens to be such medicine as Holt \\' s Pills and Elixir , the less you swallow of it the better , \" said Felix . \" But truth-vendors and medicine-vendors usually recommend swallowing . When a man sees his livelihood in a pill or a proposition , he likes to have orders for the dose , and not curious enquiries . \" This speech verged on rudeness , but it was delivered with a brusque openness that implied the absence of any personal intention . The minister \\' s daughter was now for the first time startled into looking at Felix . But her survey of this unusual speaker was soon made , and she relieved her father from the need to reply by saying — \" The tea is poured out , father . \" That was the signal for Mr . Lyon to advance toward the table , raise his right hand , and ask a blessing at sufficient length for Esther to [ 63 ] glance at the visitor again . There seemed to be no danger of his looking at her : he was observing her father . She had time to remark that he was a peculiar looking person , but not insignificant , which was the quality that most hopelessly consigned a man to perdition . He was massively built . The striking points in his face were large clear gray eyes and full lips . \" Will you draw up to the table , Mr . Holt ? \" said the minister . In the act of rising , Felix pushed back his chair too suddenly against the rickety table close by him , and down went the blue-frilled work-basket , flying open , and dispersing on the floor reels , thimble , muslin-work , a small sealed bottle of attar of rose , and something heavier than these—a duodecimo volume which fell near him between the table and the fender . \" Oh , my stars ! \" said Felix , \" I beg your pardon . \" Esther had already started up , and with wonderful quickness had picked up half the small rolling things while Felix was lifting the basket and the book . This last had opened , and had its leaves crushed in falling ; and , with the instinct of a bookish man , he saw nothing more pressing to be done than to flatten the corners of the leaves . \" Byron \\' s Poems ! \" he said , in a tone of disgust , while Esther was recovering all the other articles . \" \\' The Dream \\' — he \\' d better have been asleep and snoring . What ! do you stuff your memory with Byron , Miss Lyon ? \" Lobsters and Crabs , though exceedingly different in figure , have propensities and habits of great similarity . They annually cast their shells , and obtain new ones , completely hardened , in little more than forty-eight hours . They are extremely fierce and voracious , but when they chance to lose a limb in their frequent combats , it is completely renewed in about three weeks . If a lobster be new , it has a pleasant scent at that part of the tail which joins to the body , and the tail will , when opened , fall smart , like a spring ; but when stale , it has a rank scent , and the tail limber and flagging . If it be spent , a white scurf will issue from the mouth and roots of the small legs . If it be full , the tail , about the middle , will be full of hard reddish skinned meat , which you may discover by thrusting a knife between the joints , on the bend of the tail . The heaviest are best , if there be no water in them . The cock is generally smaller than the hen , of a deeper red when boiled , has no spawn or seed under its tail , and the uppermost fins within its tail are stiff and hard . Lobsters are in season during the summer months . Cray Fish — should be chosen by the same rules as lobsters . Crabs . — The heaviest are best , whether small or large , and those of a middling size are sweetest . If light they are watery ; when in perfection the joints of the legs are stiff , and the body has a very agreeable smell . The eyes look dead and loose when stale . Prawns and Shrimps , if they are hard and stiff , of a pleasant scent , and their tails turned strongly inward , are new ; but if they are limber , their colour faded , of a faint smell , and feel slimy , they are stale . Oysters . — The oysters of this country are unlike those of some others ; a single one of which , it has been said , will serve several persons for a meal . With us , the smallest kinds , particularly those termed Natives , which come into season rather later than the others , are generally the sweetest . For eating raw , the native is indeed preferable to all others . The rock oyster is the largest , and suits admirably for stewing , & c . ; but if eaten raw , it usually has a coarse and strong flavour . PART . III . An offer at the Improvement , and Melioration of the Aer of LONDON , by way of Plantations , & c . THere goes a pleasant Tale of a certain Sr Politick , that in the last great Plague projected , how by a Vessel fraight with peel \\' d Onions , which should passe along the Thames by the City , when the Wind fate in a favourable quarter , to attract the pollution of the Aer , and sail away with the Infection to the Sea : Transplantation of Diseases we sometimes read of amongst the Magneticall , or rather Magical Cures ; but never before of this way of Transfretation : but , however this excellent conceit has often afforded good mirth on the Stage , and I now mention to prevent the application to what I hope propound ; There is yet another expedient , which I have here to offer ( were This of the poisonous and filthy smoak remov \\' d ) by which the City and environs about it , might be rendred one of the most pleasant and agreeable places in the world . In order to this I propose . That all low-grounds circumjacent to the City , especially East and South-west , be cast and contriv \\' d into square plots , or Fields of twenty , thirty , and forty Akers , or more , separated from each others by Fences of double Palisads , or Contr \\' spaliers , which should enclose a Plantation of an hundred and fifty , or more , feet deep , about each Field ; not much unlike to what His Majesty has already begun by the wall from Old Spring-garden to St . Iames \\' s in that Park ; and is somewhat resembled in the new Spring-garden at Lambeth . That these Palisad \\' s be elegantly planted , diligently kept and supply \\' d , with such Shrubs , as yield the most fragrant and odoriferous Flowers , and are aptest to tinge the Aer upon every gentle emission at a great distance : Such as are ( for instance amongst many others ) the Sweet-brier , all the Periclymena \\' s and Woodbinds ; the Common white and yellow Iessamine , both the Syringa \\' s or Pipe trees ; the Guelder-Rose , the Musk , and all other Roses ; Genista Hispanica : To these may be added the Rubus odoratus , Bayes , Iuniper , Lignum-vitae , Laevander : but above all , Rosemary , the Flowers whereof are credibly reported to give their sent above thirty Leagues off at Sea , upon the coasts of Spain : and at some distance towards the Meadow side , Vines , yea , Hops . — Et Arbuta passim , * Et Glaucas Salices , Casiamque Crocumque rebentem , Et pinguem Tiliam , & ferrugineos Hyacinthos , & c . For , there is a very sweet smelling Sally , and the blossoms of the Tilia or Lime-tree , are incomparably fragrant ; in brief , whatsoever is odoriferous and refreshing . That the Spaces , or Aera between these Palisads , and Fences , be employ \\' d in Beds and Bordures of Pinks , Carnations , Clove , Stock-gilly-flower , Primroses , Aurieulds , Violets , not forgetting the White , which are in flower twice a year , April and August : Cowslips , Lillies , Nareissus , Strawberries , whose very leaves as well as fruit , emit a Cardiaque , and most refreshing Halitus : also Parietaria Lutea , Musk , Lemmon , and Mastick , Thyme : Spike , Cammomile , Balm , Mint , Marjoram , Pempernel , and Serpillum , & c . which upon the least pressure and cutting , breathe out and betray their ravishing odors . That the Fields , and Crofts within these Closures , or Invironing Gardens , be , some of them , planted with wild Thyme , and others reserved for Plots of Beans , Pease ( not Cabbages , whose rotten and perishing stalks have a very noisom and unhealthy smell , and therefore by Hyppocrates utterly condemned near great Cities ) but such blossom-bearing Grain as send forth their virtue at farthest distance , and are all of them marketable at London ; by which means , the Aer and Winds perpetually fann \\' d from so many circling and encompassing Hedges , fragrant Shrubs , Trees , and Flowers ( the amputation and prunings of whose superfluities , may in Winter , on some occasions of weather , and winds , be burnt , to visit the City with a more benign smoak ) not onely all that did approach the Region , which is properly design \\' d to be Flowery ; but even the whole City , would be sensible of the sweet and ravishing varieties of the perfumes , as well as of the most delightful and pleasant objects , and places of Recreation for the Inhabitants ; yielding also a Prospect of a noble and masculine Majesty , by reason of the frequent plantations of Trees , and Nurseries for Ornament , Profit , and Security : The remainder of the Fields included , yielding the same , and better Shelter , and Pasture for Sheep and Cattel then now ; that they lie bleak , expos \\' d and abandon \\' d to the winds , which perpetually invade them . That , to this end , the Gardiners ( which now cultivate the upper , more drie and ungrateful soil ) be encouraged to begin Plantations in such places onely : and the farther exorbitant encrease of Tenements , poor and nasty Cottages near the City , be prohibited , which disgrace and take off from the sweetness and amoenity of the Environs of London , and are already become a great Eye-sore in the grounds opposite to His Majesty \\' s Palace of White hall ; which being converted to this use , might yield a diversion inferior to none that could be imagin \\' d for Health , Profit , and Beauty , which are the three Transcendencies that render a place without all exception . And this is what ( in short ) I had to offer , for the Improvement and Melioration of the Aer about London , and with which I shall conclude this discourse . FINIS . It does not seem necessary to enter here into the theological meaning of each separate act of censing , all no doubt are the result of the teaching of the Spirit of God ; but there is one point of such great antiquity , and of such singular pathos , that it should not be omitted . Of course it will be remembered how usually , almost universally , in the primitive Church , the martyrs were buried under the Altar , and so it came about that the Priest , while censing the Altar at the South end , stooped down and censed the feet of the dear servant of Christ , and then again his head , when he was cpme to the North , and the whole body as he passed back from North to South . The bodies of the Saints are but rarely there now , but the Church has continued her method of censing , wrapping all , both quick and dead , in the all availing inter cession of Her Great Head . It is no part of our intention to claim a Scriptural authority , or suggestion even , of every detail of the present method of using Incense in the Christian Church . We distinctly affirm with St . Thomas ( vide loc . cit . ) that its use does not rest upon the authority of the Mosaic law , but upon that of the Christian Church alone . We are ready to admit with many of the learned , among whom may be numbered Aquinas , De Vert , and Scudamore ( against others of equal learning ) , that the desire of producing a sweet smell in a place which otherwise would have been foul , may have had something to do with its introduction into the Christian Church , as it undoubtedly had something to do with its being ordered by Moses for use in the Tabernacle made of skins . We affirm , with Tertullian , that we use Incense in a fashion different from the heathen , to wit in a swinging censer , and not in a standing vessel , as the Pagans did . We are of opinion that the censing of persons and things is the only method of using Incense which is distinctly Christian ; and finally we deny that it is possible to find in this custom of the Church ( be its antiquity what it may ) any superstition , or the setting forth of any doctrine other than the perfect sufficiency of the Sacrifice of Calvary , and the need of all being gathered in one through the intercession of the Eternal Victim , which for a sweet savour rises before the Mercy Seat on High . Love in insects seeks similar expression to fear , and secretions , it is to be believed , furnish suitable means of intercourse , especially in fragrance-loving creatures like butterflies . Quite lately Dr . Fritz Muller , who is prosecuting entomological research in the virgin forests of Brazil , stated that he was brought to consider as sexual organs for the diffusion of odours the various pencils , tufts and manes of hair , and the chalky , silky , or velvety spots of peculiar scales , as well as the recurved margin or other pouches enclosing pale buff or white down , which distinguish the wings of many of the brilliant exotic male butterflies . And in a general way this assumption is by no means improbable ; for although instances occur where these insignia appear in the opposite sex in measure , and , as evolutionists would state it , acquired by the males , they have been transmitted in the lapse of time to their consorts , yet otherwise , in a majority of cases , they seem truly masculine . In the Papilionidae , for instance , the front wings of the males have sometimes an oval chalky spot on their under side , opposite to which there is a dark brownish spot on the upper side of the hind wings , both spots emitting a strong disagreeable odour . At other times , the scent spot on the fore wings is replaced by a brush of hair , and that on the hind wing is chalky and fragrant of musk , as may be seen in the common canary-coloured butterflies of the tropics , Callidryas . Here likewise the females show on either side of their anal organs a shining spot odoriferous of a volatile acid . A third example we may find in the male of our English Clouded Yellows , where the chalky spot is seen without the brush , the pot of rose-water without the sprinkler . In other genera certain “ plumules / \\' or club-shaped scales , fringed with fine hair , have been accused of possessing scent properties . Our small White Butterfly , belonging to one of these , has a male , according to Kirby , redolent of thyme , and with some of his exotic fraternity the scent is described by Dr . Muller as delicious ; but in such cases a caution , as Professor Westwood has noticed , is doubtless needful , for may not these bright beings that bathe in sunlight and vapoury distillations the livelong day , gather odour as they fly about . We have many moths , likewise , with raised scales on the wing-surface , but I am not aware this is the source of scent attraction . Lastly , organs of perfume are said to exist in the sub-family of the Swallow Tails along the anal margin of the hind wings of the males , which is then recurved . They are evinced by a tuft of hair with a disagreeable odour . In the Nymphalidae , or great group of butterflies with rudimentary forelegs , we find some of the common cosmopolitan Dana \\' inse have dactylate hollow processes at the abdominal extremity , which are furnished with hairs , and on protrusion emit a disagreeable odour ; and sexual pouches , possibly in connection , exist on the first median nervure of the hind wing in a few species ; both being seen in the tawny Danais , that extends its range to Southern Europe . Others of the Ithonia group have a tuft of long hair near the anterior margin of the hind wings , sometimes common to the sexes , and flavouring of vanilla , while the males have a brown spot covered by the tuft . The spot and brush of the Yellow Callidryas are reproduced in one of the Satyrinse , and in some of the Nymphalinse ; while in the male of the blue Ageronia Arethusa a rather strong odour is emitted by two large brown spots , situated between the wings , which appear absent in others of this musical genus . The gdorious blue satin Morphos , the pride of Brazilian forest trees , have protrusible hemispherical anal appendages , which sometimes are odoriferous of vanilla ; and in the Brassolinse , another bulky South American progeny , pencils of erectile hairs or spots of scales are present . So , too , the peculiar long-winged ITeliconinse of the glades have scent organs in the male , situated between the anal valves , and in the female these are placed on the dorsal side of the abdominal extremity ; but some have also a scent-brush , if conclusion may be drawn from a figure in the volume on “ Foreign Butterflies , ” belonging to the Naturalist \\' s Library series . But Didonis Biblis , according to Dr . Muller , is , so far as odours are concerned , the most interesting of all these fairy-formed and many-coloured things of the tropical bush . On seizing one of these butterflies of either sex , it pushes from between the fourth and fifth segment of the abdomen two hemispherical protuberances producing a disagreeable odour ; and the male has a second pair between the fifth and sixth segments of the abdomen , while a different musk-like odour is produced by a black spot beneath the front wings . In the tailed Hair Streaks the sexual spot that may be seen on the disc of the front wings of the female of our green sort , is said to be odorous ; and if so , this is a singular instance of a scent secretion supplanting a fixed wing colour . The Skipper Butterflies , diurnal over our northern hills and woodland , amid the scorching tropical glare are known as evening visitors , stealing mysteriously to hang at the garden lupins in purple dusk , before a reflex light has awoke a second and chaotic dawn . They neither in colour as a rule bear the burnish and talismanic impress of the sunlight , or in form do they attain the feathery etherealness of the day fliers ; their antennae and various organs seem fairly heavy and moth-like , and moth-like also are the expansile scent pencils of hair that garnish the hind tibiae of the legs of many of the males . Passing to the Burnet kind , a like incarnation of the union of night and day , the males of exotic Glaucopidae have two long retractable filaments , generally beset with hairs , on the ventral side of the abdomen , sometimes emitting a strong odour . Bristling scent pencils , however , are most characteristic of the moths , and these usually distinguish the males , although , being commonly retained in their pouches , their presence is little suspected until they have been pricked out with a needle-point ; but in the twilight Sphinges , especially quick of nerve , they are sometimes found present in both sexes , and sharp fear , as we touch or grasp the ilower-hoverer reposing in diurnal lethargy , will cause their momentary expansion . Thus when the male Death \\' s-Head Moth is on the point of Squeaking in our fingers , as its abdomen inflates , a sessile pencil of yellow hair starts from a fold between the dorsal and ventral arcs at the base ( Plate V . , Fig . 7b ) , expanding to a stellate form with swift whirling motion , like a trundled mop ( Fig . 7a ) ; and immediately there arises an oily volatile effluvia , resembling the scent of jessamines , but soon becoming nauseous . This fluid aroma , secreted near the insertion of the “ fans , \" and traversing by capillary attraction to their extremity , stains them bright orange at the glands , shaded into yellow at their tip . Similar “ fans \" in the Convolvulus Hawk convey the sensation of amber or musk , and their anatomy has been investigated by Prof . Targioni , who describes the hyperdomal tissue opposite the insertion of the “ fans \" as composed of hexagonally nucleated pyriform cells , from each of which proceeds a tube to the base of the several hairs of the fascicle , which are inserted by means of a process ; so that the unicellular glandules secrete the odoriferous matter , and the hairs become their excretory ducts . These “ fans \" are likewise said to exist in the male Privet Hawk Moth , and may characterise the genus Sphinx . An assortment of passages about smell in theatres , 1820s - 1910s . Source : Thomas Jefferson Hogg , Two Hundred and Nine Days ; or , The Journal of a Traveller on the Continent ( London : Hunt and Clarke , 1827 ) , pp . 72 - 73 Text : [ Saturday , 10 December 1825 ] I visited in the evening a theatre , named Teatro del Fondo ; there was an opera and a ballet ; the performance was good , the house commodious , and the price of admission moderate ; but great was the smell of garlic . At a small theatre this was to be expected ; for at the great theatre of S . Carlo , I had complained , that my place was too remote , and was brought much nearer the stage amongst a higher order of beings into a sort of fops-alley ; but the fops smelt so strong of garlic , that it was difficult to live in the atmosphere of this more refined society . I had frequent examples of what I had heard before , that when the Italians are pleased with a performance , they hiss , to command silence and attention ; the opera , and especially the ballet , were received this evening with much hissing , that is , they gave great satisfaction . At the end of the ballet , the audience called for the ballet-master ; the curtain was drawn up immediately , and a melancholy man in a suit of black was led on the stage between Cupid and Psyche , in the midst of the smoke and flames with which the piece had concluded ; to express , as I was told by a lady , who , perceiving that I was a stranger , kindly took much pains to make me understand the whole allegory , the glowing ardours of love ; he was hailed with loud applauses , and retired bowing , with an air of modest confusion , that would have been becoming even to Psyche herself .

Reproduced in The Uncommercial Traveller ( 1861 , 1868 , 1875 ) Text : My uncommercial curiosity induced me to go into every nook of this great place , and among every class of the audience assembled in it—amounting that evening , as I calculated , to about two thousand and odd hundreds . Magnificently lighted by a firmament of sparkling chandeliers , the building was ventilated to perfection . My sense of smell , without being particularly delicate , has been so offended in some of the commoner places of public resort , that I have often been obliged to leave them when I have made an uncommercial journey expressly to look on . The air of this Theatre was fresh , cool , and wholesome . To help towards this end , very sensible precautions had been used , ingeniously combining the experience of hospitals and railway stations . Asphalt pavements substituted for wooden floors , honest bare walls of glazed brick and tile—even at the back of the boxes—for plaster and paper , no benches stuffed , and no carpeting or baize used ; a cool material with a light glazed surface , being the covering of the seats .

Doran , 1913 ) , pp . 13 - 20 Text : They regarded our tickets with gestures of scorn , weariness , and cupidity . None knew better than they that these coloured scraps represented a large lovely gold coin , rare and yet plentiful , reassuring and yet transient , the price of coals , boots , nectar , and love . We came to a very narrow , low , foul , semi-circular tunnel which was occupied by hags and harpies with pink bows in their hair , and by marauding men , and by hats and cloaks and overcoats , and by a double odour of dirt and disinfectants . Along the convex side of the tunnel were a number of little doors like the doors of cells . We bought a programme from a man , yielded our wraps to two harpies , and were led away by another man . All these beings looked hungrily apprehensive , like dogs nosing along a gutter . The auditorium which was nearly full , had the same characteristics as the porch and the couloir . It was filthy , fetid , uncomfortable , and dangerous . It had the carpets of a lodging-house of the ‘ seventies , the seats of an old omnibus , the gilt and the decorated sculpture of a circus at a fair . And it was dingy ! It was encrusted with dinginess ! There is not in Italy , they say ( and I believe them ) a lovelier residence than the Palazzo Peschiere , or Palace of the Fishponds , whither we removed as soon as our three months \\' tenancy of the Pink Jail at Albaro had ceased and determined . It stands on a height within the walls of Genoa , but aloof from the town : surrounded by beautiful gardens of its own , adorned with statues , vases , fountains , marble basins , terraces , walks of orange trees and lemon trees , groves of roses and camelias . All its apartments are beautiful in their proportions and decorations ; but the great hall , some fifty feet in height , with three large windows at the end , overlooking the whole town of Genoa , the harbour , and the neighbouring sea , affords one of the most fascinating and delightful prospects in the world . Any house more cheerful and habitable than the great rooms are , within , it would be difficult to conceive ; and certainly nothing more delicious than the scene without , in sunshine or in moonlight , could be imagined . It is more like an enchanted palace in an Eastern story than a grave and sober lodging . How you may wander on , from room to room , and never tire of the wild fancies on the walls and ceilings , as bright in their fresh colouring as if they had been painted yesterday ; or how one floor , or even the great hall which opens on eight other rooms , is a spacious promenade ; or how there are corridors and bed-chambers above , which we never use and rarely visit , and scarcely know the way through ; or how there is a view of a perfectly different character on each of the four sides of the building ; matters little . But that prospect from the hall , is like a vision to me . I go back to it , in fancy , as I have done in calm reality a hundred times a-day ; and stand there , looking out , with the sweet scents from the garden rising up about me , in a perfect dream of happiness . There lies all Genoa , in beautiful confusion , with its many churches , monasteries , and convents , pointing up into the sunny sky ; and down below me , just where the roofs begin , a solitary convent parapet , fashioned like a gallery , with an iron cross at the end , where sometimes , early in the morning , I have seen a little group of dark-veiled nuns gliding sorrowfully to and fro , and stopping now and then to peep down upon the waking world in which they have no part . Old Monte Faccio , brightest of hills in good weather , but sulkiest when storms are coming on , is here , upon the left . The Fort within the walls ( the good King built it to command the town , and beat the houses of the Genoese about their ears , in case they should be discontented ) commands that height upon the right . The broad sea lies beyond , in front there ; and that line of coast , beginning by the light-house , and tapering away , a mere speck in the rosy distance , is the beautiful coast road that leads to Nice . The garden near at hand , among the roofs and houses : all red with roses and fresh with little fountains : is the Acqua Sola—a public promenade , where the military band plays gaily , and the white veils cluster thick , and the Genoese nobility ride round , and round , and round , in state-clothes and coaches at least , if not in absolute wisdom . Within a stone \\' s-throw , as it seems , the audience of the Day-Theatre sit : their faces turned this way . But as the stage is hidden , it is very odd , without a knowledge of the cause , to see their faces change so suddenly from earnestness to laughter ; and odder still , to hear the rounds upon rounds of applause , rattling in the evening air , to which the curtain falls . But , being Sunday night , they act their best and most attractive play . And now , the sun is going down , in such magnificent array of red , and green , and golden light , as neither pen nor pencil could depict ; and to the ringing of the vesper bells , darkness sets in at once , without a twilight . Then , lights begin to shine in Genoa , and on the country road ; and the revolving lantern out at sea there , flashing , for an instant , on this palace front and portico , illuminates it as if there were a bright moon bursting from behind a cloud ; then , merges it in deep obscurity . And this , so far as I know , is the only reason why the Genoese avoid it after dark , and think it haunted . My memory will haunt it , many nights , in time to come ; but nothing worse , I will engage . The same Ghost \" will occasionally sail away , as I did one pleasant Autumn evening , into the bright prospect , and snuff the morning air at Marseilles . The corpulent hair-dresser was still sitting in his slippers outside his shop-door there , but the twirling ladies in the window , with the natural inconstancy of their sex , had ceased to twirl , and were languishing , stock still , with their beautiful faces addressed to blind corners of the establishment , where it was impossible for admirers to penetrate . The steamer had come from Genoa in a delicious run of eighteen hours , and we were going to run back again by the Cornice Road from Nice : not being satisfied to have seen only the outsides of the beautiful towns that rise in picturesque white clusters from among the olive woods , and rocks , and hills , upon the margin of the Sea . The Boat which started for Nice that night , at eight o \\' clock , was very small , and so crowded with goods that there was scarcely room to move ; neither was there anything to eat on board , except bread ; nor to drink , except coffee . But being due at Nice at about eight or so in the morning , this was of no consequence : so when we began to wink at the bright stars , in involuntary acknowledgement of their winking at us , we turned into our berths , in a crowded , but cool little cabin , and slept soundly till morning . The Boat , being as dull and dogged a little boat as ever was built , it was within an hour of noon when we turned into Nice Harbour , where we very little expected anything but breakfast . But we were laden with wool . Wool must not remain in the Custom House at Marseilles more than twelve months at a stretch , without paying duty . It is the custom to make fictitious removals of unsold wool to evade this law ; to take it somewhere when the twelve months are nearly out ; bring it straight back again ; and warehouse it , as a new cargo , for nearly twelve months longer . This wool of ours , had come originally from some place in the East . It was recognised as Eastern produce , the moment we entered the harbour . Accordingly , the gay little Sunday boats , full of holiday people , which had come off to greet us , were warned away by the authorities ; we were declared in quarantine ; and a great flag was solemnly run up to the mast-head on the wharf , to make it known to all the town . It was a very hot day indeed . We were unshaved , unwashed , undressed , unfed , and could hardly enjoy the absurdity of lying blistering in a lazy harbour , with the town looking on from a respectful distance , all manner of whiskered men in cocked hats discussing our fate at a remote guard-house , with gestures ( we looked very hard at them through telescopes ) expressive of a week \\' s detention at least : and nothing whatever the matter all the time . But even in this crisis the Brave Courier achieved a triumph . He telegraphed somebody ( I saw nobody ) either naturally connected with the hotel , or put en rapport with the establishment for that occasion only . The telegraph was answered , and in half an hour or less , there came a loud shout from the guard-house . The captain was wanted . Everybody helped the captain into his boat . Everybody got his luggage , and said we were going . The captain rowed away , and disappeared behind a little jutting corner of the Galley-slaves \\' Prison : and presently came back with something , very sulkily . The Brave Courier met him at the side , and received the something as its rightful owner . It was a wicker-basket , folded in a linen cloth ; and in it were two great bottles of wine , a roast fowl , some salt fish chopped with garlic , a great loaf of bread , a dozen or so of peaches , and a few other trifles . When we had selected our own breakfast , the Brave Courier invited a chosen party to partake of these refreshments , and assured them that they need not be deterred by motives of delicacy , as he would order a second basket to be furnished at their expense . Which he did—no one knew how—and by and by , the captain being again summoned , again sulkily returned with another something ; over which my popular attendant presided as before : carving with a clasp-knife , his own personal property , something smaller than a Roman sword . The whole party on board were made merry by these unexpected supplies ; but none more so , than a loquacious little Frenchman , who got drunk in five minutes , and a sturdy Cappuccino Friar , who had taken everybody \\' s fancy mightily , and was one of the best friars in the world , I verily believe . He had a free , open countenance ; and a rich brown , flowing beard ; and was a remarkably handsome man , of about fifty . He had come up to us , early in the morning , and inquired whether we were sure to be at Nice by eleven ; saying that he particularly wanted to know , because if we reached it by that time he would have to perform mass , and must deal with the consecrated wafer , fasting ; whereas , if there were no chance of his being in time , he would immediately breakfast . He made this communication , under the idea that the Brave Courier was the captain ; and indeed he looked much more like it than anybody else on board . Being assured that we should arrive in good time , he fasted , and talked , fasting , to everybody , with the most charming good-humour ; answering jokes at the expense of friars , with other jokes at the expense of laymen , and saying that friar as he was , he would engage to take up the two strongest men on board , one after the other , with his teeth , and carry them along the deck . Nobody gave him the opportunity , but I dare say he could have done it ; for he was a gallant , noble figure of a man , even in the Cappuccino dress , which is the ugliest and most ungainly that can well be . All this had given great delight to the loquacious Frenchman , who gradually patronised the Friar very much , and seemed to commiserate him as one who might have been born a Frenchman himself , but for an unfortunate destiny . Although his patronage was such as a mouse might bestow upon a lion , he had a vast opinion of its condescension ; and in the warmth of that sentiment , occasionally rose on tiptoe , to slap the Friar on the back . When the baskets arrived : it being then too late for Mass : the Friar went to work bravely ; eating prodigiously of the cold meat and bread , drinking deep draughts of the wine , smoking cigars , taking snuff , sustaining an uninterrupted conversation with all hands , and occasionally running to the boat \\' s side and hailing somebody on shore with the intelligence that we must be got out of this quarantine somehow or other , as he had to take part in a great religious procession in the afternoon . After this , he would come back , laughing lustily from pure good-humour : while the Frenchman wrinkled his small face into ten thousand creases , and said how droll it was , and what a brave boy was that Friar ! At length the heat of the sun without , and of the wine within , made the Frenchman sleepy . So , in the noontide of his patronage of his gigantic protegé , he lay down among the wool , and began to snore . It was four o \\' clock before we were released ; and the Frenchman , dirty and woolly , and snuffy , was still sleeping when the Friar went ashore . As soon as we were free , we all hurried away , to wash and dress , that we might make a decent appearance at the Procession ; and I saw no more of the Frenchman until we took up our station in the main street to see it pass , when he squeezed himself into a front place , elaborately renovated ; threw back his little coat , to show a broad-barred velvet waistcoat sprinkled all over with stars ; and adjusted himself and his cane so as utterly to bewilder and transfix the Friar , when he should appear . The procession was a very long one , and included an immense number of people divided into small parties ; each party chaunting nasally , on its own account , without reference to any other , and producing a most dismal result . There were angels , crosses , Virgins carried on flat boards surrounded by Cupids , crowns , saints , missals , infantry , tapers , monks , nuns , relics , dignitaries of the church in green hats , walking under crimson parasols : and , here and there , a species of sacred street-lamp hoisted on a pole . We looked out anxiously for the Cappuccini , and presently their brown robes and corded girdles were seen coming on , in a body . I observed the little Frenchman chuckle over the idea that when the Friar saw him in the broad-barred waistcoat , he would mentally exclaim , \" Is that my Patron ! That distinguished man ! \" and would be covered with confusion . Ah ! never was the Frenchman so deceived . As our friend the Cappuccino advanced , with folded arms , he looked straight into the visage of the little Frenchman , with a bland , serene , composed abstraction , not to be described . There was not the faintest trace of recognition or amusement on his features ; not the smallest consciousness of bread and meat , wine , snuff , or cigars . \" C \\' est lui-même , \" I heard the little Frenchman say , in some doubt . Oh yes , it was himself . It was not his brother or his nephew , very like him . It was he . He walked in great state : being one of the Superiors of the Order : and looked his part to admiration . There never was anything so perfect of its kind as the contemplative way in which he allowed his placid gaze to rest on us , his late companions , as if he had never seen us in his life and didn \\' t see us then . The Frenchman , quite humbled , took off his hat at last , but the Friar still passed on , with the same imperturbable serenity ; and the broad-barred waistcoat , fading into the crowd , was seen no more . The procession wound up with a discharge of musketry that shook all the windows in the town . Next afternoon we started for Genoa , by the famed Cornice Road . The half-French , half-Italian Vetturíno , who undertook , with his little rattling carriage and pair , to convey us thither in three days , was a careless , good-looking fellow , whose light-heartedness and singing propensities knew no bounds as long as we went on smoothly . So long , he had a word and a smile and a flick of his whip , for all the peasant girls , and odds and ends of the Somnambula for all the echoes . So long , he went jingling through every little village , with bells on his horses and rings in his ears : a very meteor of gallantry and cheerfulness . But , it was highly characteristic to see him under a slight reverse of circumstances , when , in one part of the journey , we came to a narrow place where a waggon had broken down and stopped up the road . His hands were twined in his hair immediately , as if a combination of all the direst accidents in life had suddenly fallen on his devoted head . He swore in French , prayed in Italian , and went up and down , beating his feet on the ground in a very ecstasy of despair . There were various carters and mule-drivers assembled round the broken waggon , and at last some man , of an original turn of mind , proposed that a general and joint effort should be made to get things to-rights again , and clear the way—an idea which I verily believe would never have presented itself to our friend , though we had remained there until now . It was done at no great cost of labour ; but at every pause in the doing , his hands were wound in his hair again , as if there were no ray of hope to lighten his misery . The moment he was on his box once more , and clattering briskly down hill , he returned to the Somnambula and the Peasant girls , as if it were not in the power of misfortune to depress him . Much of the romance of the beautiful towns and villages on this beautiful road , disappears when they are entered , for many of them are very miserable . The streets are narrow , dark , and dirty ; the inhabitants lean and squalid ; and the withered old women , with their wiry grey hair twisted up into a knot on the top of the head , like a pad to carry loads on , are so intensely ugly , both along the Riviera , and in Genoa too , that , seen straggling about in dim door-ways with their spindles , or crooning together in by corners , they are like a population of Witches—except that they certainly are not to be suspected of brooms or any other instrument of cleanliness . Neither are the pig-skins , in common use to hold wine , and hung out in the sun in all directions , by any means ornamental , as they always preserve the form of very bloated pigs , with their heads and legs cut off , dangling upside-down by their own tails . These towns , as they are seen in the approach , however : nestling , with their clustering roofs and towers , among trees on steep hill-sides , or built upon the brink of noble bays : are charming . The vegetation is , everywhere , luxuriant and beautiful , and the Palm tree makes a novel feature in the novel scenery . In one town , San Remo—a most extraordinary place , built on gloomy open arches , so that one might ramble underneath the whole town—there are pretty terrace gardens ; in other towns , there is the clang of shipwrights \\' hammers , and the building of small vessels on the beach . In some of the broad bays , the fleets of Europe might ride at anchor . In every case , each little group of houses presents , in the distance , some enchanting confusion of picturesque and fanciful shapes . The road itself—now high above the glittering sea , which breaks against the foot of the precipice : now turning inland to sweep the shore of a bay : now crossing the stony bed of a mountain stream : now low down on the beach : now winding among riven rocks of many forms and colours : now chequered by a solitary ruined tower , one of a chain of towers built , in old time , to protect the coast from the invasions of the Barbary Corsairs—presents new beauties every moment . When its own striking scenery is passed , and it trails on through a long line of suburb on the flat sea-shore , to Genoa , then , the changing glimpses of that noble city and its Harbour , awaken a new source of interest ; freshened by every huge , unwieldy , half-inhabited old house in its outskirts ; and coming to its climax when the city Gate is reached , and all Genoa with its beautiful harbour , and neighbouring hills , bursts proudly on the view . TO PARMA , MODENA , AND BOLOGNA . I strolled away from Genoa on the 6th of November , bound for a good many places ( England among them ) , but first for Piacenza ; for which town I started in the coupé of a machine something like a travelling caravan , in company with the Brave Courier , and a lady with a large dog , who howled dolefully , at intervals , all night . It was very wet , and very cold ; very dark , and very dismal ; we travelled at the rate of barely four miles an hour , and stopped nowhere for refreshment . At ten o \\' clock next morning , we changed coaches at Alessandria , where we were packed up in another coach ( the body whereof would have been small for a fly ) , in company with a very old priest ; a young Jesuit , his companion—who carried their breviaries and other books , and who , in the exertion of getting into the coach , had made a gash of pink leg between his black stocking and his black knee-shorts , that reminded one of Hamlet in Ophelia \\' s closet , only it was visible on both legs—a provincial Avvocáto ; and a gentleman with a red nose that had an uncommon and singular sheen upon it , which I never observed in the human subject before . In this way we travelled on , until four o \\' clock in the afternoon ; the roads being still very heavy , and the coach very slow . To mend the matter , the old priest was troubled with cramps in his legs , so that he had to give a terrible yell every ten minutes or so , and be hoisted out by the united efforts of the company ; the coach always stopping for him , with great gravity . This disorder , and the roads , formed the main subject of conversation . Finding , in the afternoon , that the coupé had discharged two people , and had only one passenger inside—a monstrous ugly Tuscan , with a great purple moustache , of which no man could see the ends when he had his hat on—I took advantage of its better accommodation , and in company with this gentleman ( who was very conversational and good-humoured ) travelled on , until nearly eleven o \\' clock at night , when the driver reported that he couldn \\' t think of going any farther , and we accordingly made a halt at a place called Stradella . The inn was a series of strange galleries surrounding a yard ; where our coach , and a waggon or two , and a lot of fowls , and firewood , were all heaped up together , higgledy-piggledy ; so that you didn \\' t know , and couldn \\' t have taken your oath , which was a fowl and which was a cart . We followed a sleepy man with a flaring torch , into a great , cold room , where there were two immensely broad beds , on what looked like two immensely broad deal dining-tables ; another deal table of similar dimensions in the middle of the bare floor ; four windows ; and two chairs . Somebody said it was my room ; and I walked up and down it , for half an hour or so , staring at the Tuscan , the old priest , the young priest , and the Avvocáto ( Red-Nose lived in the town , and had gone home ) , who sat upon the beds , and stared at me in return . The rather dreary whimsicality of this stage of the proceedings , is interrupted by an announcement from the Brave ( he has been cooking ) that supper is ready ; and to the priest \\' s chamber ( the next room and the counterpart of mine ) we all adjourn . The first dish is a cabbage , boiled with a great quantity of rice in a tureen full of water , and flavoured with cheese . It is so hot , and we are so cold , that it appears almost jolly . The second dish is some little bits of pork , fried with pigs \\' kidneys . The third , two red fowls . The fourth , two little red turkeys . The fifth , a huge stew of garlic and truffles , and I don \\' t know what else ; and this concludes the entertainment . Before I can sit down in my own chamber , and think it of the dampest , the door opens , and the Brave comes moving in , in the middle of such a quantity of fuel that he looks like Birnam Wood taking a winter walk . He kindles this heap in a twinkling , and produces a jorum of hot brandy and water ; for that bottle of his keeps company with the seasons , and now holds nothing but the purest eau de vie . When he has accomplished this feat , he retires for the night ; and I hear him , for an hour afterwards , and indeed until I fall asleep , making jokes in some out-house ( apparently under the pillow ) , where he is smoking cigars with a party of confidential friends . He never was in the house in his life before ; but he knows everybody everywhere , before he has been anywhere five minutes ; and is certain to have attracted to himself , in the meantime , the enthusiastic devotion of the whole establishment . This is at twelve o \\' clock at night . At four o \\' clock next morning , he is up again , fresher than a new-blown rose ; making blazing fires without the least authority from the landlord ; producing mugs of scalding coffee when nobody else can get anything but cold water ; and going out into the dark streets , and roaring for fresh milk , on the chance of somebody with a cow getting up to supply it . While the horses are \" coming , \" I stumble out into the town too . It seems to be all one little Piazza , with a cold damp with blowing in and out of the arches , alternately , in a sort of pattern . But it is profoundly dark , and raining heavily ; and I shouldn \\' t know it to-morrow , if I were taken there to try . Which Heaven forbid ! The horses arrive in about an hour . In the interval , the driver swears : sometimes Christian oaths , sometimes Pagan oaths . Sometimes , when it is a long , compound oath , he begins with Christianity and merges into Paganism . Various messengers are despatched ; not so much after the horses , as after each other ; for the first messenger never comes back , and all the rest imitate him . At length the horses appear , surrounded by all the messengers ; some kicking them , and some dragging them , and all shouting abuse to them . Then , the old priest , the young priest , the Avvocáto , the Tuscan , and all of us , take our places ; and sleepy voices proceeding from the doors of extraordinary hutches in divers parts of the yard , cry out \" Addio corrière mio ! Buon \\' viággio , corrière ! \" Salutations which the courier , with his face one monstrous grin , returns in like manner as we go jolting and wallowing away , through the mud . At Piacenza , which was four or five hours \\' journey from the inn at Stradella , we broke up our little company before the hotel door , with divers manifestations of friendly feeling on all sides . The old priest was taken with the cramp again , before he had got halfway down the street ; and the young priest laid the bundle of books on a door step , while he dutifully rubbed the old gentleman \\' s legs . The client of the Avvocáto was waiting for him at the yard-gate , and kissed him on each cheek , with such a resounding smack , that I am afraid he had either a very bad case , or a scantily-furnished purse . The Tuscan , with a cigar in his mouth , went loitering off , carrying his hat in his hand that he might the better trail up the ends of his dishevelled moustache . And the Brave Courier , as he and I strolled away to look about us , began immediately to entertain me with the private histories and family affairs of the whole party . A brown , decayed , old town , Piacenza is , A deserted , solitary , grass-grown place , with ruined ramparts ; half filled-up trenches , which afford a frowsy pasturage to the lean kine that wander about them ; and streets of stern houses , moodily frowning at the other houses over the way . The sleepiest and shabbiest of soldiery go wandering about , with the double curse of laziness and poverty , uncouthly wrinkling their misfitting regimentals ; the dirtiest of children play with their impromptu toys ( pigs and mud ) in the feeblest of gutters ; and the gauntest of dogs trot in and out of the dullest of archways , in perpetual search of something to eat , which they never seem to find . A mysterious and solemn Palace , guarded by two colossal statues , twin Genii of the place , stands gravely in the midst of the idle town ; and the king with the marble legs , who flourished in the time of the thousand and one Nights , might live contentedly inside of it , and never have the energy , in his upper half of flesh and blood , to want to come out . What a strange , half-sorrowful and half-delicious doze it is , to ramble through these places gone to sleep and basking in the sun ! Each , in its turn , appears to be , of all the mouldy , dreary , God-forgotten towns in the wide world , the chief . Sitting on this hillock where a bastion used to be , and where a noisy fortress was , in the time of the old Roman station here , I become aware that I have never known till now , what it is to be lazy . A dormouse must surely be in very much the same condition before he retires under the wool in his cage ; or a tortoise before he buries himself . I feel that I am getting rusty . That any attempt to think , would be accompanied with a creaking noise . That there is nothing , anywhere , to be done , or needing to be done . That there is no more human progress , motion , effort , or advancement , of any kind beyond this . That the whole scheme stopped here centuries ago , and lay down to rest until the Day of Judgment . Never while the Brave Courier lives ! Behold him jingling out of Piacenza , and staggering this way , in the tallest posting-chaise ever seen , so that he looks out of the front window as if he were peeping over a garden wall ; while the postilion , concentrated essence of all the shabbiness of Italy , pauses for a moment in his animated conversation , to touch his hat to a blunt-nosed little Virgin , hardly less shabby than himself , enshrined in a plaster Punch \\' s show outside the town . In Genoa , and thereabouts , they train the vines on trellis-work , supported on square clumsy pillars , which , in themselves , are anything but picturesque . But , here , they twine them around trees , and let them trail among the hedges ; and the vineyards are full of trees , regularly planted for this purpose , each with its own vine twining and clustering about it . Their leaves are now of the brightest gold and deepest red ; and never was anything so enchantingly graceful and full of beauty . Through miles of these delightful forms and colours , the road winds its way . The wild festoons ; the elegant wreaths , and crowns , and garlands of all shapes ; the fairy nets flung over great trees , and making them prisoners in sport ; the tumbled heaps and mounds of exquisite shapes upon the ground ; how rich and beautiful they are ! And every now and then , a long , long line of trees , will be all bound and garlanded together : as if they had taken hold of one another , and were coming dancing down the field ! Parma has cheerful , stirring streets , for an Italian town ; and consequently is not so characteristic as many places of less note . Always excepting the retired Piazza , where the Cathedral , Baptistery , and Campanile—ancient buildings , of a sombre brown , embellished with innumerable grotesque monsters and dreamy-looking creatures carved in marble and red stone—are clustered in a noble and magnificent repose . Their silent presence was only invaded , when I saw them , by the twittering of the many birds that were flying in and out of the crevices in the stones and little nooks in the architecture , where they had made their nests . They were busy , rising from the cold shade of Temples made with hands , into the sunny air of Heaven . Not so the worshippers within , who were listening to the same drowsy chaunt , or kneeling before the same kinds of images and tapers , or whispering , with their heads bowed down , in the very selfsame dark confessionals , as I had left in Genoa and everywhere else . The decayed and mutilated paintings with which this church is covered , have , to my thinking , a remarkably mournful and depressing influence . It is miserable to see great works of art—something of the Souls of Painters—perishing and fading away , like human forms . This cathedral is odorous with the rotting of Coreggio \\' s frescoes in the Cupola . Heaven knows how beautiful they may have been at one time . Connoisseurs fall into raptures with them now ; but such a labyrinth of arms and legs : such heaps of foreshortened limbs , entangled and involved and jumbled together : no operative surgeon , gone mad , could imagine in his wildest delirium . There is a very interesting subterranean church here ; the roof supported by marble pillars , behind each of which there seemed to be at least one beggar in ambush : to say nothing of the tombs and secluded altars . From every one of these lurking-places , such crowds of phantom-looking men and women , leading other men and women with twisted limbs , or chattering jaws , or paralytic gestures , or idiotic heads , or some other sad infirmity , came hobbling out to beg , that if the ruined frescoes in the cathedral above , had been suddenly animated , and had retired to this lower church , they could hardly have made a greater confusion , or exhibited a more confounding display of arms and legs . There is Petrarch \\' s Monument , too ; and there is the Baptistery , with its beautiful arches and immense font ; and there is a gallery containing some very remarkable pictures , whereof a few were being copied by hairy-faced artists , with little velvet caps more off their heads than on . There is the Farnese Palace , too ; and in it one of the dreariest spectacles of decay that ever was seen—a grand , old , gloomy theatre , mouldering away . It is a large wooden structure , of the horse-shoe shape ; the lower seats arranged upon the Roman plan , but above them , great heavy chambers rather than boxes , where the Nobles sat , remote , in their proud state . Such desolation as has fallen on this theatre , enhanced in the spectator \\' s fancy by its gay intention and design , none but worms can be familiar with . A hundred and ten years have passed , since any play was acted here . The sky shines in through the gashes in the roof ; the boxes are dropping down , wasting away , and only tenanted by rats ; damp and mildew smear the faded colours , and make spectral maps upon the panels ; lean rags are dangling down where there were gay festoons on the Proscenium ; the stage has rotted so , that a narrow wooden galley is thrown across it , or it would sink beneath the tread , and bury the visitor in the gloomy depth beneath . The desolation and decay impress themselves on all the senses . The air has a mouldering smell , and an earthy taste ; any stray outer sounds that straggle in with some lost sunbeam , are muffled and heavy ; and the worm , the maggot , and the rot have changed the surface of the wood beneath the touch , as time will seam and roughen a smooth hand . If ever Ghosts act plays , they act them on this ghostly stage . It was most delicious weather , when we came into Modena , where the darkness of the sombre colonnades over the footways skirting the main street on either side , was made refreshing and agreeable by the bright sky , so wonderfully blue . I passed , from all the glory of the day , into a dim cathedral , where high mass was performing , feeble tapers were burning , people were kneeling in all directions before all manner of shrines , and officiating priests were crooning the usual chaunt , in the usual low , dull , drawling , melancholy tone . Thinking how strange it was , to find , in every stagnant town , this same Heart beating with the same monotonous pulsation , the centre of the same torpid , listless system , I came out by another door , and was suddenly scared to death by a blast from the shrillest trumpet that ever was blown . Immediately , came tearing round the corner , an equestrian company from Paris : marshalling themselves under the walls of the church , and flouting , with their horses \\' heels , the griffins , lions , tigers , and other monsters in stone and marble , decorating its exterior . First , there came a stately nobleman with a great deal of hair , and no hat , bearing an enormous banner , on which was inscribed , Mazeppa ! to-night ! Then , a Mexican chief , with a great pear-shaped club on his shoulder , like Hercules . Then , six or eight Roman chariots : each with a beautiful lady in extremely short petticoats , and unnaturally pink tights , erect within : shedding beaming looks upon the crowd , in which there was a latent expression of discomposure and anxiety , for which I couldn \\' t account , until , as the open back of each chariot presented itself , I saw the immense difficulty with which the pink legs maintained their perpendicular , over the uneven pavement of the town : which gave me quite a new idea of the ancient Romans and Britons . The procession was brought to a close , by some dozen indomitable warriors of different nations , riding two and two , and haughtily surveying the tame population of Modena : among whom , however , they occasionally condescended to scatter largesse in the form of a few handbills . After caracolling among the lions and tigers , and proclaiming that evening \\' s entertainments with blast of trumpet , it then filed off , by the other end of the square , and left a new and greatly increased dulness behind . When the procession had so entirely passed away , that the shrill trumpet was mild in the distance , and the tail of the last horse was hopelessly round the corner , the people who had come out of the church to stare at it , went back again . But , one old lady , kneeling on the pavement within , near the door , had seen it all , and had been immensely interested , without getting up ; and this old lady \\' s eye , at that juncture , I happened to catch : to our mutual confusion . She cut our embarrassment very short , however , by crossing herself devoutly , and going down , at full length , on her face , before a figure in a fancy petticoat and a gilt crown ; which was so like one of the procession-figures , that perhaps at this hour she may think the whole appearance a celestial vision . Anyhow , I must certainly have forgiven her , her interest in the Circus , though I had been her Father Confessor . There was a little fiery-eyed old man with a crooked shoulder , in the cathedral , who took it very ill that I made no effort to see the bucket ( kept in an old tower ) which the people of Modena took away from the people of Bologna in the fourteenth century , and about which there was war made and a mock-heroic poem by Tasso , too . Being quite content , however , to look at the outside of the tower , and feast , in imagination , on the bucket within ; and preferring to loiter in the shade of the tall Campanile , and about the cathedral ; I have no personal knowledge of this bucket , even at the present time . Indeed , we were at Bologna , before the little old man ( or the Guide-Book ) would have considered that we had half done justice to the wonders of Modena . But it is such a delight to me to leave new scenes behind , and still go on , encountering newer scenes—and , moreover I have such a perverse disposition in respect of sights that are cut , and dried , and dictated—that I fear I sin against similar authorities in every place I visit . Be this as it may , in the pleasant Cemetery at Bologna I found myself walking next Sunday morning , among the stately marble tombs and colonnades , in company with a crowd of Peasants , and escorted by a little Cicerone of that town , who was excessively anxious for the honour of the place , and most solicitous to divert my attention from the bad monuments : whereas he was never tired of extolling the good ones . Seeing this little man ( a good-humoured little man he was , who seemed to have nothing in his face but shining teeth and eyes ) looking , wistfully , at a certain plot of grass , I asked him who was buried there . \" The poor people , Signore , \" he said with a shrug and a smile , and stopping to look back at me—for he always went on a little before , and took off his hat to introduce every new monument . \" Only the poor , Signore ! It \\' s very cheerful . It \\' s very lively . How green it is , how cool ! It \\' s like a meadow ! There are five , \" — holding up all the fingers of his right hand to express the number , which an Italian peasant will always do , if it be within the compass of his ten fingers , — \" there are five of my little children buried there , Signore ; just there ; a little to the right . Well ! Thanks to God ! It \\' s very cheerful . How green it is , how cool it is ! It \\' s quite a meadow ! \" He looked me very hard in the face , and seeing I was sorry for him , took a pinch of snuff ( every Cicerone takes snuff ) , and made a little bow ; partly in deprecation of his having alluded to such a subject , and partly in memory of the children and of his favourite saint . It was as unaffected and as perfectly natural a little bow , as ever man made . Immediately afterwards , he took his hat off altogether , and begged to introduce me to the next monument ; and his eyes and his teeth shone brighter than before . Our tyrant having left the ship , and carried his favourite Mackshane along with him , to my inexpressible satisfaction ; our new commander came on board , in a ten-oar \\' d barge , overshadowed with a vast umbrella , and appeared in every thing quite the reverse of Oakhum , being a tall , thin , young man , dressed in this manner ; a white hat garnished with a red feather , adorned his head , from whence his hair flowed down upon his shoulders , in ringlets tied behind with a ribbon . His coat , consisting of pink-coloured silk , lined with white , by the elegance of the cut retired backward , as it were , to discover a white sattin waistcoat embroidered with gold , unbuttoned at the upper part , to display a broch set with garnets , that glittered in the breast of his shirt , which was of the finest cambrick , edged with right mechlin : The knees of his crimson velvet breeches scarce descended so low as to meet his silk stockings , which rose without spot or wrinkle on his meagre legs , from shoes of blue Meroquin , studded with diamond buckles , that flamed forth rivals to the sun ! A steel-hilted sword , inlaid with figures of gold , and decked with a knot of ribbon which fell down in a rich tossle , equipped his side ; and an amber-headed cane hung dangling from his wrist : But the most remarkable parts or his furniture were , a mask on his face , and white gloves on his hands , which did not seem to be put on with an intention to be pulled off occasionally , but were fixed with a ring set with a ruby on the little finger of one hand , and by one set with a topaz on that of the other . In this garb , captain Whiffle , for that was his name , took possession of the ship , surrounded with a crowd of attendants , all of whom , in their different degrees , seemed to be of their patron \\' s disposition ; and the air was so impregnated with perfumes , that one may venture to affirm the clime of Arabia Foelix was not half so sweet scented . My fellow-mate , observing no surgeon among his train , thought he had found an occasion too favourable for himself to be neglected ; and remembring the old proverb , \" Spare to speak , and spare to speed , \" resolved to sollicit the new captain \\' s interest immediately , before any other surgeon could be appointed for the ship . With this view he repaired to the cabbin , in his ordinary dress , consisting of a check-shirt and trousers , a brown linen waistcoat , and a night-cap of the same , neither very clean , which for his further misfortune , happened to smell strong of tobacco . Entering without any ceremony , into this sacred place , he found captain Whiffle reposing upon a couch , with a wrapper of fine chintz about his body , and a muslin cape bordered with lace upon his head ; and after several low conge \\' s , began in this manner : \" Sir , I hope you will forgive , and excuse , and pardon the presumption of one who has not the honour of being known unto you , but who is , nevertheless , a shentleman porn and pred , and moreover has had misfortunes , Got help me , in the world . \" Here he was interrupted by the captain , who at first sight of him had started up with great amazement at the novelty of the apparition ; and having recollected himself , pronounced , with a look and tone signifying disdain , curiosity and surprize , \" Zauns ! who art thou ? \" \" I am surgeon \\' s first first mate on board of this ship ( replied Morgan ) and I most vehemently desire and beseech you with all submission , to be pleased to condescend and vouchsafe to enquire into my character , and my pehaviour , and my deserts , which , under Got , I hope , will entitle me to the vacancy of surgeon . \" As he proceeded in his speech , he continued advancing towards the captain , whose nostrils were no sooner saluted with the aromatick flavour that exhaled from him ; than he cried with great emotion , \" Heaven preserve me ! I am suffocated ! Fellow , Fellow , away with thee ! Curse thee , fellow ! get thee gone , I shall be stunk to death ! \" At the noise of his outcries , his servants run into his apartment , and he accosted them thus ; \" Villains ! cut-throats ! traitors ! I am betrayed ! I am sacrificed ! Will you not carry that monster away ? or must I be stifled with the stench of him ? oh ! oh ! \" With these interjections , he sunk down upon his settee in a fit ; his valet de chambre plied him with a smelling-bottle , one footman chased his temples with Hungary water , another sprinkled the floor with spirits of lavender , and a third pushed Morgan out of the cabbin ; who coming to the place where I was , sat down with a demure countenance , and , according to his custom , when he received any indignity which he durst not revenge , began to sing a Welch ditty . I guessed he was under some agitation of spirits , and desired to know the cause ; but instead of answering me directly , he asked with great emotion , if I thought him a monster and a stinkard ? \" A monster and a stinkard ( said I , with some surprize ) did any body call you so ? \" \" Got is my judge ( replied he ) captain Fifle did call me both ; ay , and all the water in the Tawy will not wash it out of my remembrance . I do affirm , and avouch , and maintain , with my soul , and my pody , and my plood , look you , that I have no smells about me , but such as a christian ought to have , except the effluvia of topacco , which is a cephalic , odoriferous , aromatick herb , and he is a son of a mountain-goat who says otherwise . As for my being a monster , let that be as it is ; I am as Got was pleased to create me , which , peradventure , is more than I shall aver of him who gave me that title ; for I will proclaim it before the world , that he is disguised , and transfigured , and transmographied with affectation and whimsies ; and that he is more like a papoon than one of the human race . \" Captain Whiffle sends for me his situation described his surgeon arrives , prescribes for him , and puts him to bed a bed is put up for Mr . Simper contiguous to the stateroom , which , with other parts of the captain \\' s behaviour , gives the ship \\' s company a very unfavourable idea of their commander I am detained in the West-Indies , by the admiral , and go on board of the Lizard sloop of war , in quality of surgeon \\' s mate , where I make myself known to the Surgeon , who treats me very kindly I go on shore , sell my ticket , purchase necessaries , and at my return on board , am surprized at the sight of Crampley , who is appointed lieutenant of the sloop we sail on a cruize take a prize , in which I arrive at Port Morant , under the command of my mess mate , with whom I live in great harmony . HE was going on , with an elogium upon the captain , when I received a message to clean myself , and go up to the great cabbin , which I immediately performed , sweetening myself with rose-water from the medicine-chest . When I entered the room , I was ordered to stand by the door , until captain Whiffle had reconnoitred me at a distance , with a spy-glass , who having consulted one sense in this manner , bid me advance gradually , that his nose might have intelligence , before it could be much offended : I therefore approached with great caution and success , and he was pleased to say , \" Ay , this creature is tolerable . \" I found him lolling on his couch with a languishing air , his head supported by his valet de chambre , who from time to time applied a ? smelling ? - bottle to his nose . \" Vergette , ( said he , in a squeaking tone ) dost thou think this wretch ( meaning me ) will do me no injury ? may I venture to submit my arm to him ? \" \" Pon my vord , ( replied the valet ) I do tink dat dere be great occasion for your honour losing one small quantite of blodt ; and the yong mun ave qulque chose of de bonne mine . \" Well then ( said his master ) I think I must venture . \" Then addressing himself to me , \" Hast thou ever blooded any body but brutes ? But I need not ask thee , for thou wilt tell me a most damnable lie . \" \" Brutes , Sir , ( answered I , pulling down his glove in order to feel his pulse ) I never meddle with brutes . \" \" What the devil art thou about ? ( cried he ) dost thou intend to twist off my hand ? Gad \\' s curse ! my arm is benumbed up to the very shoulder ! Heaven have mercy upon me ! must I perish under the hands of savages ? What an unfortunate dog was I to come on board without my own surgeon , Mr . Simper . \" I craved pardon for having handled him so roughly , and with the utmost care and tenderness tied up his arm with a fillet of silk . While I was seeling for the vein , he desired to know how much blood I intended to take from him , and when I answered , \" Not above twelve ounces ; \" started up with a look full of horror , and bid me begone , swearing I had a design upon his life . Vergette appeased him with some difficulty , and opening a bureau , took out a pair of scales , in one of which was placed a small cup ; and putting them into my hand , told me , the captain never lost above an ounce and three drachms at one time . While I prepared for this important evacuation , there came into the cabbin , a young man , gayly dressed , of a very delicate complexion , with a kind of languid smile on his face , which seemed to have been rendered habitual , by a long course of affectation . The captain no sooner perceived him , than rising hastily , he flew into his arms , crying , \" O ! my dear Simper ! I am excessively disordered ! I have been betrayed , frighted , murdered by the negligence of my servants , who suffered a beast , a mule , a bear to surprize me , and stink me into convulsions with the fumes of tobacco . \" Simper , who by this time , I found , was obliged to art for the clearness of his complexion , assumed an air of softness and sympathy , and lamented with many tender expressions of sorrow , the sad accident that had thrown him into that condition ; then feeling his patient \\' s pulse on the outside of his glove , gave it as his opinion , that his disorder was entirely nervous , and that some drops of tincture of castor and liquid laudanum , would be of more service to him than bleeding , by bridling the inordinate sallies of his spirits , and composing the fermentation of his bile proceeding therefrom . I was therefore sent to prepare this prescription , which was administred in a glass of sack-posset , after the captain had been put to bed , and orders sent to the officers on the quarter-deck , to let no body walk on that side under which he lay . While the captain enjoyed his repose , the doctor watched over him , and indeed became so necessary , that a cabin was made for him contiguous to the state-room , where Whiffle slept ; that he might be at hand in case of accidents in the night . Next day , our commander being happily recovered , gave orders , that none of the lieutenants should appear upon deck , without a wig , sword , and ruffles ; nor any midshipman , or other petty officer , be seen with a check shirt or dirty linen . He also prohibited any person whatever , except Simper and his own servants , from coming into the great cabbin , without first sending in to obtain leave . These singular regulations did not prepossess the ship \\' s company in his favour ; but on the contrary , gave scandal an opportunity to be very busy with his character , and accuse him of maintaining a correspondence with his surgeon , not fit to be named . Ferment oil of Erica vulgaris . The fresh herb is treated as above , the distillate is cohobated and repeatedly distilled after addition of common salt , then sliaken up with ether and the ether carefully distilled off from the dissolved oil . The oil is greenish-yellow , mobile , lighter than water , with a peculiar odour and sweet , aromatic , huining taste . It reddens litmus paper and burns with a clear , blue-edged dame without leaving any residue . Ferment oil of Marrubium vulgare . The comminuted herb is soaked in water and exposed to the sun , whereby it acquires an offensive odour ; the liquid is then distilled , the distillate saturated with common salt ; the flocks thereby separated are collected on a filter and dissolved in ether and the ether slowly evaporated . The oil is lighter than water , has a peculiar sweet , ethereaT odour , and an aromatic , slightly biting taste . It burns without leaving any residue , “ With chlorine water it emits an odour of roses . It dissolves in aqueous alkalies and in water . \" Ferment oil of Achillea millefolium ( “ Milfoil ” or common “ Yarrow ” ) . The fresh flowering plant is macerated in water and left to ferment ; the whole is distilled with cohobation . The blue oil which floats on the distillate is removed ; the residual water , after addition of common salt , is agitated with ether and the ether which separates is evaporated off . It is a yellow-brown oil having a slightly aromatic odour and an aromatic , bitter , rather sharp taste . It dissolves in alcohol , ether and oils fixed and volatile . Ferment oil of various species of Plantago . The plantain leaves are macerated , fermented , and distilled as above , and the distillate exhausted with ether in the same way . It is a yellow , transparent oil with an ethereal odour and an aromatic , sweet , burning taste . It is very volatile . With fuming nitric acid it turns brown , with rise in temperature . The solution first becomes greenish-yellow , with milky turbidity , then clear , smells like artificial musk and has a very bitter taste . It dissolves in alcohol , ether and oils .

It reddens litmus and is easily intlamniable , giving first a bluish , then whitish , non - fuliginous flame which emits a penetrating odour . With fuming nitric acid it froths up and becomes very hot , but does not lose its odour . It dissolves sparingly in water ; rapidly in alcohol , ether , and oils both fixed and volatile . Ferment oil of Salix pontandra . ( This willow is common in the North of England and Ireland ; it is remarkable for its large glossy leaves , more like those of a Portugal Laurel than of the other willows . Its foliage is fragrant . ) The oil is obtained from the fresh leaves in the same manner as above . It is yellow , lighter than water , has an agreeable aromatic odour like that of castoreum and , at the same time , like that of the leaves . It reddens litmus ; smells strongly when heated , and burns with a very smoky flame , leaving a small quantity of charcoal . Ferment oil of Tussilago farfara ( “ Coltsfoot ” ) . The fresh bruised herb is macerated in water for 10 or 12 days , during which it turns light green and acquires the odour of pickled gherkins . The whole is then distilled . The distillate , which has a vinous odour , is saturated with common salt and re-distilled ; this second distillate is shaken up with a large quantity of ether and the ether taken off and evaporated , the oil remaining beliind . It is yellowish , lighter than water , very volatile , has a peculiar , strongly aromatic , penetrating odour and an aromatic taste neither burning nor cooling . It easily takes fire and burns at first vith a whitish afterwards with a reddish smoky flame . It dissolves sparingly in water ; rapidly in alcohol or ether . Ferment oil of Trifolium fibrini ( a species of clover ) . This oil is obtained from the dried plant . After the plant has been well boiled with water and no longer has a bitter smell , by fermentation , distillation , saturating the distillate with common salt and abstraction by ether as before described . It is pale yellow , lighter than water , smells strongly aromatic , like the ferment oil of Tussilago farfara . Its taste is at first burning and sweetish , afterwards aromatic . It burns with a blue , slightly fuliginous flame , giving off strong smelling vapours which excite coughing , and leaves a small quantity of charcoal . It dissolves sparingly in water , easily in alcohol and ether . Ferment oil of Urtica urens ( “ The Small Xettle ” ) , obtained as above , but from the fresh , flowering plant , which during fermentation emits first a vinous , then a sharp and intoxicating odour . It resembles tlie ferment oil of Echium vulgare . Ferment oil of Vitis vinifera ( the Grape Vine ) . Fermented vine leaves are distilled , the distillate cohobated ; the result of the second distillation abstracted with ether , and after evaporation of the ether the oil remains as usual . It is pale yellow , lighter than water , has a peculiar vinous odour like wine-flowers and mignonette , and a burning , sweetish , aromatic taste . It reddens litmus slightly but permanently . It evaporates in the air , diffusing a strong odour . Heated with fuming nitric acid it resinifies and assumes a grass-green colour . With sulphuric acid it forms first a white , then a light red , and ultimately a brown mixture , without losing its odour . It is not deodorised by agitation with chlorine water . With aqueous potash it forms a clear mixture from whicli the oil afterwards separates with red-brown colour , but with its original odour . It dissolves sparingly in water , abundantly in alcohol , ether and fixed oils . With oil of turpentine and oil of lemon it forms at first a milky solution , which afterwards becomes clear .

Keep it for your companions in beastliness , I am none of them , sir . If I had not already forgiven you a greater trespass , or thought you yet worth my beating , I would instruct your manners , to whom you made your offers . But go your ways , talk not to me , the hangman is only fit to discourse with you ; the hand of beadle is too merciful a punishment for your trade of life . [ Exit Edgworth . ] — I am sorry I employ ’ d this fellow , for he thinks me such ; facinus quos inquinat , æquat . But it was for sport ; and would I make it serious , the getting of this license is nothing to me , without other circumstances concur . I do think how impertinently I labour , if the word be not mine that the ragged fellow mark ’ d : and what advantage I have given Ned Winwife in this time now of working her , though it be mine . He ’ ll go near to form to her what a debauched rascal I am , and fright her out of all good conceit of me : I should do so by him , I am sure , if I had the opportunity . But my hope is in her temper yet ; and it must needs be next to despair , that is grounded on any part of a woman ’ s discretion . I would give , by my troth now , all I could spare , to my clothes and my sword , to meet my tatter ’ d soothsayer again , who was my judge in the question , to know certainly whose word he has damn ’ d or saved ; for till then I live but under a reprieve .

CHAP . LVI . Of the Adulteration of Musk , Civet and Ambergriese . BY reason that these choice Perfumes are often adulterated or counterfeited , we shall do our endeavour to discover the cheat , lest any being deceived thereby should suffer loss . I . Musk is often adulterated by mixing Nutmegs , Mace , Cinnamon , Cloves , Spicknard of each alike in a fine or impalpable powder with warm blood of Pidgeons , and then dryed in the Sun , then beaten again , and moistened with Musk water drying and repeating the same work eight or ten times ; adding at last a quarter part of pure Musk by moistening and mixing with Musk water ; then dividing the mass into several parts , and rouling them in the hair of a goat , which grows under his tail . II . Others adulterate it thus : By filling the Musk cods with Goats blood , and a little toasted bread , mixed with a quarter part of Musk , well beaten together . The cheat is discerned by the brightness of the Goats blood . III . Or thus , Take Storax , Labdanum , powder of Xylo-aloes , of each four ounces , Musk and Civet of each half an ounce , mix all together with Rose water . The cheat is discerned , by its easie dissolving in water , and its different colour and scent . IV . Or thus , Take Goats blood , powder of Angelica roots , Musk of each alike , make a mixture . V . To adulterate Civet : Mix with it the Gall of an Oxe , and Storax liquefied and washed : or you may adulterate it by the addition of Honey of Crete . VI . To restore the lost scent to Musk , or Ambergriese . This is done , by hanging it some time in a Jakes or house of Office ; for by these ill scents , its innate vertue and odour is excited and revived . CHAPTER V . Several adventurers that happened to the author . The execution of a criminal . The author shows his skill in navigation . I should have lived happy enough in that country , if my littleness had not exposed me to several ridiculous and troublesome accidents ; some of which I shall venture to relate . Glumdalclitch often carried me into the gardens of the court in my smaller box , and would sometimes take me out of it , and hold me in her hand , or set me down to walk . I remember , before the dwarf left the queen , he followed us one day into those gardens , and my nurse having set me down , he and I being close together , near some dwarf apple trees , I must needs show my wit , by a silly allusion between him and the trees , which happens to hold in their language as it does in ours . Whereupon , the malicious rogue , watching his opportunity , when I was walking under one of them , shook it directly over my head , by which a dozen apples , each of them near as large as a Bristol barrel , came tumbling about my ears ; one of them hit me on the back as I chanced to stoop , and knocked me down flat on my face ; but I received no other hurt , and the dwarf was pardoned at my desire , because I had given the provocation . Another day , Glumdalclitch left me on a smooth grass-plot to divert myself , while she walked at some distance with her governess . In the meantime , there suddenly fell such a violent shower of hail , that I was immediately by the force of it , struck to the ground : and when I was down , the hailstones gave me such cruel bangs all over the body , as if I had been pelted with tennis-balls ; however , I made a shift to creep on all fours , and shelter myself , by lying flat on my face , on the lee-side of a border of lemon-thyme , but so bruised from head to foot , that I could not go abroad in ten days . Neither is this at all to be wondered at , because nature , in that country , observing the same proportion through all her operations , a hailstone is near eighteen hundred times as large as one in Europe ; which I can assert upon experience , having been so curious as to weigh and measure them . But a more dangerous accident happened to me in the same garden , when my little nurse , believing she had put me in a secure place ( which I often entreated her to do , that I might enjoy my own thoughts , ) and having left my box at home , to avoid the trouble of carrying it , went to another part of the garden with her governess and some ladies of her acquaintance . While she was absent , and out of hearing , a small white spaniel that belonged to one of the chief gardeners , having got by accident into the garden , happened to range near the place where I lay : the dog , following the scent , came directly up , and taking me in his mouth , ran straight to his master wagging his tail , and set me gently on the ground . By good fortune he had been so well taught , that I was carried between his teeth without the least hurt , or even tearing my clothes . But the poor gardener , who knew me well , and had a great kindness for me , was in a terrible fright : he gently took me up in both his hands , and asked me how I did ? but I was so amazed and out of breath , that I could not speak a word . In a few minutes I came to myself , and he carried me safe to my little nurse , who , by this time , had returned to the place where she left me , and was in cruel agonies when I did not appear , nor answer when she called . She severely reprimanded the gardener on account of his dog . But the thing was hushed up , and never known at court , for the girl was afraid of the queen ’ s anger ; and truly , as to myself , I thought it would not be for my reputation , that such a story should go about . This accident absolutely determined Glumdalclitch never to trust me abroad for the future out of her sight . I had been long afraid of this resolution , and therefore concealed from her some little unlucky adventures , that happened in those times when I was left by myself . Once a kite , hovering over the garden , made a stoop at me , and if I had not resolutely drawn my hanger , and run under a thick espalier , he would have certainly carried me away in his talons . Another time , walking to the top of a fresh mole-hill , I fell to my neck in the hole , through which that animal had cast up the earth , and coined some lie , not worth remembering , to excuse myself for spoiling my clothes . I likewise broke my right shin against the shell of a snail , which I happened to stumble over , as I was walking alone and thinking on poor England . I cannot tell whether I were more pleased or mortified to observe , in those solitary walks , that the smaller birds did not appear to be at all afraid of me , but would hop about within a yard ’ s distance , looking for worms and other food , with as much indifference and security as if no creature at all were near them . I remember , a thrush had the confidence to snatch out of my hand , with his bill , a piece of cake that Glumdalclitch had just given me for my breakfast . When I attempted to catch any of these birds , they would boldly turn against me , endeavouring to peck my fingers , which I durst not venture within their reach ; and then they would hop back unconcerned , to hunt for worms or snails , as they did before . But one day , I took a thick cudgel , and threw it with all my strength so luckily , at a linnet , that I knocked him down , and seizing him by the neck with both my hands , ran with him in triumph to my nurse . However , the bird , who had only been stunned , recovering himself gave me so many boxes with his wings , on both sides of my head and body , though I held him at arm ’ s length , and was out of the reach of his claws , that I was twenty times thinking to let him go . But I was soon relieved by one of our servants , who wrung off the bird ’ s neck , and I had him next day for dinner , by the queen ’ s command . This linnet , as near as I can remember , seemed to be somewhat larger than an English swan . The maids of honour often invited Glumdalclitch to their apartments , and desired she would bring me along with her , on purpose to have the pleasure of seeing and touching me . They would often strip me naked from top to toe , and lay me at full length in their bosoms ; wherewith I was much disgusted because , to say the truth , a very offensive smell came from their skins ; which I do not mention , or intend , to the disadvantage of those excellent ladies , for whom I have all manner of respect ; but I conceive that my sense was more acute in proportion to my littleness , and that those illustrious persons were no more disagreeable to their lovers , or to each other , than people of the same quality are with us in England . And , after all , I found their natural smell was much more supportable , than when they used perfumes , under which I immediately swooned away . I cannot forget , that an intimate friend of mine in Lilliput , took the freedom in a warm day , when I had used a good deal of exercise , to complain of a strong smell about me , although I am as little faulty that way , as most of my sex : but I suppose his faculty of smelling was as nice with regard to me , as mine was to that of this people . Upon this point , I cannot forbear doing justice to the queen my mistress , and Glumdalclitch my nurse , whose persons were as sweet as those of any lady in England . That which gave me most uneasiness among these maids of honour ( when my nurse carried me to visit them ) was , to see them use me without any manner of ceremony , like a creature who had no sort of consequence : for they would strip themselves to the skin , and put on their smocks in my presence , while I was placed on their toilet , directly before their naked bodies , which I am sure to me was very far from being a tempting sight , or from giving me any other emotions than those of horror and disgust : their skins appeared so coarse and uneven , so variously coloured , when I saw them near , with a mole here and there as broad as a trencher , and hairs hanging from it thicker than packthreads , to say nothing farther concerning the rest of their persons . Neither did they at all scruple , while I was by , to discharge what they had drank , to the quantity of at least two hogsheads , in a vessel that held above three tuns . The handsomest among these maids of honour , a pleasant , frolicsome girl of sixteen , would sometimes set me astride upon one of her nipples , with many other tricks , wherein the reader will excuse me for not being over particular . But I was so much displeased , that I entreated Glumdalclitch to contrive some excuse for not seeing that young lady any more . One day , a young gentleman , who was nephew to my nurse ’ s governess , came and pressed them both to see an execution . It was of a man , who had murdered one of that gentleman ’ s intimate acquaintance . Glumdalclitch was prevailed on to be of the company , very much against her inclination , for she was naturally tender-hearted : and , as for myself , although I abhorred such kind of spectacles , yet my curiosity tempted me to see something that I thought must be extraordinary . The malefactor was fixed in a chair upon a scaffold erected for that purpose , and his head cut off at one blow , with a sword of about forty feet long . The veins and arteries spouted up such a prodigious quantity of blood , and so high in the air , that the great jet d ’ eau at Versailles was not equal to it for the time it lasted : and the head , when it fell on the scaffold floor , gave such a bounce as made me start , although I was at least half an English mile distant . The queen , who often used to hear me talk of my sea-voyages , and took all occasions to divert me when I was melancholy , asked me whether I understood how to handle a sail or an oar , and whether a little exercise of rowing might not be convenient for my health ? I answered , that I understood both very well : for although my proper employment had been to be surgeon or doctor to the ship , yet often , upon a pinch , I was forced to work like a common mariner . But I could not see how this could be done in their country , where the smallest wherry was equal to a first-rate man of war among us ; and such a boat as I could manage would never live in any of their rivers . Her majesty said , if I would contrive a boat , her own joiner should make it , and she would provide a place for me to sail in . The fellow was an ingenious workman , and by my instructions , in ten days , finished a pleasure-boat with all its tackling , able conveniently to hold eight Europeans . When it was finished , the queen was so delighted , that she ran with it in her lap to the king , who ordered it to be put into a cistern full of water , with me in it , by way of trial , where I could not manage my two sculls , or little oars , for want of room . But the queen had before contrived another project . She ordered the joiner to make a wooden trough of three hundred feet long , fifty broad , and eight deep ; which , being well pitched , to prevent leaking , was placed on the floor , along the wall , in an outer room of the palace . It had a cock near the bottom to let out the water , when it began to grow stale ; and two servants could easily fill it in half an hour . Here I often used to row for my own diversion , as well as that of the queen and her ladies , who thought themselves well entertained with my skill and agility . Sometimes I would put up my sail , and then my business was only to steer , while the ladies gave me a gale with their fans ; and , when they were weary , some of their pages would blow my sail forward with their breath , while I showed my art by steering starboard or larboard as I pleased . When I had done , Glumdalclitch always carried back my boat into her closet , and hung it on a nail to dry . Memorandum of Nuisance from any other cause or general remarks . In considering the question of nuisances from offensive trades it might be an infraction of personal liberty to interfere with a proprietor \\' s right to make offensive smells within the limits of his own tenement , and for his own separate inhalation , but surely it is a greater infraction of personal liberty when the proprietor assumes what is equivalent to a sole possession of the atmosphere , and claims the right of diffusing through it some nauseous effluvium which others equally with himself are thus obliged to inhale . Nuisances arising from offensive trades affect some inspectors more than others , but no offensive business can be established without the sanction of the London County Council in the Metropolis , or an urban sanitary authority in the provinces . In London , the County Council is required to give at least 14 days \\' notice to the sanitary authority of the district where the premises requiring the license are situate , to enable the latter , if necessary , to oppose the application . In Scotland offensive businesses cannot be established without the sanction of the Local Authority , whatever be the situation of the business ; and as regards slaughter houses and knackers \\' yards , a Hcense must be obtained from such Authority before they can be carried on , and this license is subject to annual renewal . The Local Government Board and the London County Council have made by-laws for regulating these businesses , and these must be enforced by the sanitary authority in the Provinces , and the County Council within the Metropolis . The Act provides that : — If any person — Establishes anew the following businesses , or any of them ; that is to say , the business of blood boiler , bone boiler , manure manufacturer , soap boiler , tallow melter , or knacker , or Establishes anew , without the sanction of the county council , the following businesses or any of them ; that is to say , the business of fellmonger , tripe boiler , slaughterer of cattle or horses , or any other business which the county council may declare by order confirmed by the Local Government Board , and published in the London Gazette to be an offensive business What Madness therefore is it , to offer Sacrifice to those who know nothing of the Matter ? To bring Light to the Blind ? To burn Incense to those who have no Breath by which they might smell it ? I have transcribed these Words , to let you see that he comprehends Thurification under the common Name of Sacrifice . 2 . Concerning the Jewish Sacrifices , he adds : Sed atis oti . ofum eft , in his demorari , qu £ in toto jam non fnt . But it is sufficiently impertinent , to spend time on these things , which now , have have wholly ceased to have any longer a Being . He could not say so if the Christians of his Age had either continued , or revived the Pratice of Incense . 3 . He mentions the Christian Sacrifices as opposed to both of them , and allows of no other Sacrifices , as agreeable to this Dispensation , but only such as are spiritual : Spiritali Deo sacrifitnm efi necesserim spiritale , quod non ex facctlo , fed ex corde profertr r : quod non branwois r . brovoJis . A Spiritual Sacrifice is necessary for a spiritual Being . Such as proceeds not from the Bag , bat from the Heart which is the Produaf not offinking Cattle , but perfumed Manners ; Ihich is not offered with bloody Hands , but ptre understanding ; Which is not killed that it may be deflroyed , but as Isaac was , is Sacrificed that it may live . I have often observed , that the Women , living near these Work-houses , complain of hysteric Passions , occasioned by the noisome Smell , which some may wonder at , upon the Consideration that sharp-smelling Things , applied to the Nostrils , are recommend ed by Hippocrates as a Remedy for hysteric Fits . But as on the one hand sweet-scented Things do not always excite hysteric Fits , in regard that Cinnamon , Nutmegs and such like odoriferous Things are Remedies against them , which Horatius Augenius cries up as infallible , and which Etmuller does not condemn , and as Hippocrates recommends the sweetest scented Wine , in his Book de Nat . Mul . So on the other hand Things of an unsavoury Smell are not always proper to check their Fits , as Forestus has well observed ; and it is an ansient Observation , that the Snuff of a Lamp raises hysteric Commotions . And therefore I do not wonder that the animal Spirits are put into disorderly Motions by the putrid Smell of Tallow ; and that thereby the Uterus suffers Convulsions along with the Stomach , which is forced upwards by the Nauseousness of the Smell . Nay I have oftentimes seen Women of a tender , nice Constitution , fall into fainting Fits and hysteric Commotions upon using the Light of a Tallow - candle . To be further satisfied of the pernicious Smell of Tallow-candles do but consult Solenander who informs you , that his Brother John contracted a violent Disorder in his Lungs and his Brain by studying hard by the Light of Tallow-candles . He adds , that Ox-tallow gives a more noisome Smell than that of Sheep : But in our Country we find that the Tallow-candles never smell so rank , as when some Hogs-tallow is one of the Ingredients . Of Muriatic Acid . Obtained by decomposing Muriate of Soda , by means similar to those employed in the preparation of the Nitric Acid . Its purest form Gaseous . In this state heavier than Atmospherical Air ; 100 cubic inches at mean pressure and temperture , weighing 39 grains ; of a pungent odour ; irrespirable ; destructive to Flame , imparting to it under extinction a bright green colour ; inflames the skin without discolouring or corroding it . \\' Formerly supposed to consist of an unknown radical intimately combined with Oxygen . Late researches of Professor Davy , by which this doctrine is controverted . When dry has no action on the Metals , nor on any other of the Combustible Substances . Exposed to a moist atmosphere it becomes cloudy — Is readily absorbed both by Water and Ice , the latter of which it liquefies : in either case it occasions an increase of Temperature and augmentation of Bulk , communicating to the water the general properties of an Acid ( Acidam Muriaticum P . L . ) ESSAY . SO prouident hath that great workeman bin of all his creatures , as no delight euen in this Tabernacle of earth , is wanting to make him more accomplished : and though the fiue Sences ( as that deuout Barnard obserueth ) be those fiue gates , by which the world doth besiege vs , the Deuill doth tempt vs , and the flesh ensnare vs ; yet in euery one of these , if rightly employed , is there a peculiar good and benefit redounding to the comfort of the soule , no lesse than to the auaile and vtilitie of the bodie . For euen by the Smell , as by the conduit , by which is conveyed vnto vs the dilated fountaine of Gods mercie , doe we apprehend all varieties of flowers , sootes , sweetes : which moued the Philosopher to terme this Sence , the Harbinger of the Spring . Some are of opinion , that this peculiar Sence , is an occasion of more danger to the body than benefit , in that it receiues crude and vnholesome vapours , foggie and corrupt exhalations , being subiect to any infection ; it is true : but what especiall delights confers it for one of these inconveniences ; cheering the whole bodie with the sweetest odours , giuing libertie to the vitall powers , which otherwise would be imprisoned , delight to her fellow-Sences , which else would be dulled , and the sweet breathing ayre , which by her is reciued : all these ( as so many arguments of consequence ) bring vs to a more exact acknowledgment of this Sences excellencie . The Smelling is termed the vnnecessariest of all other Sences , yet may it be employed in cases of necessitie ; witnesse Democritus , who against the celebration of the feast Buthysia , fasted nine dayes , sustayning nature onely with the smell of hot bread . This Sence of mine shall not be subiected to outward delicacies : Let the Courtier smell of perfumes , the sleeke-fac \\' d Lady of her paintings , I will follow the smell of my Sauiours oyntments : how should I be induced , following the direction of reason , by such soule-bewitching vanities , which rather peruert the refined lustre of the minde , than adde the least of perfection to so excellent an essence ? No , let Pigmalion dote on his owne picture , Narcissus on his shape , Niobe on her numerous progenie ; my Taste , shall be to taste how sweet the Lord is ; my Touch , the apprehension of his loue ; my sight , the contemplation of his glory ; my eare , to accent his praise ; my smell , to repose in the faire and pleasant pastures of his word . O comfort truly styled one ; in that my soule transported aboue herselfe , vnites her selfe to be ioyned to her Redeemer . The Gardens of the Hesperides warded and guarded by those three daughters of Atlas , were pleasant ; the Gardens of Lucullus fragrant ; the Groue of Ida eminent ; yet not comparable to those exquisite pleasures , which the diuine pastures comprehend ; there is that hedged Garden , that sealed Well , that Bethesda , that Eden , that Syloe ; here may the delight of euery Sence be renewed ; the thirstie satisfied , the hungry filled , the sicke cured , the labourer cheered , and the exquisite mirrour of all perfection ; torrent of euer-flowing bounties , Iessaes branch , Aarons rod , and that flowrie garden of Engaddi represented . There is mel in ore , melos in aure , iubilus in corde ; honie to the taste , melodie to the eare , and harmonie to the heart ; honie which breedes no loathing , melodie which is neuer discording , harmonie euer agreeing . This it is to be ioyned to an heau \\' nly spouse , sending from Paradice pomgranats , with the fruits of apples ; Cypresse , Nard , Nard and Saffron , * Fistula , and Cinnamon , with all the woods of Libanon , Mirrh and Aloës , with the best oyntments . What excellent delights be here proposed ? what exquisite comforts ministred ? it is sufficient for me to admire them in this pilgrimage , enioying them by contemplation , which after many pilgrim dayes I shall possesse in fruition . There is no Pomander to smell at , like the oyntment of my Sauiour : he is all sweet , all comfort , all delight ; sweet in his mercy , comfortable in his promise , and delightfull in his presence ; in his mercy a father , in his comfort a redeemer , and in his delight a replenisher ; from his mercy and compassion is deriued abundantly fulnes of consolation , from his comfort or promise , an assured expectation , and from his delight , of himselfe a plenarie possession . O would to God with happy Ioseph , I had taken downe my Sauiour from the crosse , embalmed him in the spices or graces of my soule , had layen him in the new sepulchre of my heart , that at least attending or following my IESVS , my obedience might haue ministred something to so heauenly obsequies . For how should I think but by the smell of his oyntments , my sin-sicke and soule soiled conscience should be cured , who had power to raise dead Lazarus stinking in his graue , hauing bene foure dayes buried ? O that I might goe to the mountaine of Myrrh , * to the hill of Frankincense , to be ioyned to him , whose oyntments are aboue all spices : how should I want any thing being so enriched ? how should I feare any thing being so armed ? or how wish any thing , hauing whatsoeuer I desired ? Sweet-smelling perfume of selected vertues , pure streame of diuine graces , and amiable beauty neuer blemished ; no delight shall withhold me , no affection seduce me , no inordinate pleasure entice me , no sweet smell draw me ; I haue tyed my selfe to my spouse in all my Sences ; being He , that ministers refreshment to all my Sences . The Cause of this Disease is twofold : the Retention of the Seed , and the Menstruum , which are the materiall cause : and a cold and moist distemper of the Matrix , breeding phlegmatick and thick juices , which is the efficient cause : for when the Seed is retained , and the Menstruum hath not the customary , and usuall vent , they burthen the Matrix , and choak , and extinguish the heat thereof : then upon the diminishing of the naturall heat , windy humours are bred , especially in the Matrix , which by nature is a cold , nervous , and bloudlesse part ; after the same manner , if the seed be kept too long , it disturbeth the Function of the spiritous parts , and the Midriffe , it oppresseth the heart , causeth fainting and sounding fits , bindeth as it were , and girteth about the parts , and seemes in such a manner to stop the breath , that the sick woman is in danger to be strangled : her puls is sometimes weake , various , and obscure : she hath inward discontents and anxieties , and is most commonly invaded by , at least very subject unto Convulsion fits : she lies , as if she were astonished and void of sense : and from her belly you may heare rumbling , and murmuring noises ; she breatheth so weakly , that it is scarce discernable , and indeed she is so sad an object , that the by-standers may easily mistake her to be dead . The drowsie and sleepy disease called Carus differs from this , because they who are affected with it , have the use of their breath free , without any molestation : and it differs from a Catalipsy ( another drowsie disease , casting the • • ck into a profound and dead sleep ) because they who are taken with that , lie without any motion , but they who have the mother , are tormented with Convulsion fits , their legs and their hands are stretched and wrythed into unusuall figures , and strange postures ; and by this it is distinguished from an Apoplexy , unto which it is exceeding like . Galen wondreth how these women can live , who are troubled with these cruel fits of the Mother , without any puls , or breathing , in as much as it is impossible for one that liveth not to breath , or for on • that breatheth not , to live ; for so long we live , so long we breath . To this I answer that although these women live without respiration , yet doe they not live without transpiration ; for this being performed thorough the pores of the skin , by the motion of the arteries , conserves the sym • metry of the vitall heat ; for then that small heat retiring to the heart , as to Castle , may bepreserved by this benefit of transpiration alone . Now to procure an assurance , whith • the woman be living or dead , hold a feather , or a looking-glasse to her mouth , the former stir , or the latter be spotted it is an undoubted signe that she liveth . This is a most acute Disease , and soone dispatcheth the sick woman , especially if it took beginning from somevery contagious , and poisonous vapours ; lecherous women , and lusty widowes that are prone , and apt to Venery , are most subject to it : but married women that injoy the company of their husbands , and such as are with childe , are seldome invaded by it . You must apply your Remedies in the • • t , and after the fit : in the fit , the humour just be drawn back with rubbing the parts , • ying painfull Ligatures about them , and applying Cuppinglasses , with scariffication to the calfes of her legs : have such Glysters in readinesse , as will take away the paine , dissolve , draw back , and purge out the thick humours : you may compound them by these formes following . Take halfe an ounce of Elecampane roots . The leaves of rue , penniroyall , Motherwort , and pellitory of the wall , of each a handfull . Three drams of sena . Bran , Camomile flowers , and the tops of Dill , of each halfe a handfull . Bastard Saffron , and Annise seeds , of each two drams . Boile them in a sufficient quantitie of birthwort water to nine ounces , to the strained liquor being squeezed , and press very hard , add Diaphenicon , and benedicta laxativa , of each an ounce . Oyle of dill , and oyle of rue , of each s • drams . Halfe an ounce of butter . A dram and a halfe of salt . Mingle them , and make a Glyster . Carminative medicines must be laid upon the whole inward region , as fomentation made of the leaves of Rue , Motherwort , Penniroyall , the flowers of Melilot , and Camomile , or unguent . de Althea , with the oyl of Camomile , Dill , and Rue ; for this loosen ¦ eth the passages by opening the pores , an expelling the winde ; pessaries may be p • • up , made with Civet , Musk , and Amber but you must affront her nose with stinking odours , as the steame of brimstone , the smoke ascending from old shoes burn Partridge feathers , sagapenum galbanum , as fetida , and the like , cast into the fire ; because the Matrix doth , as it were abhor , retreat , and flie from these things , whereas sweet things doe allure to them . But some curious braine may here demand , why sweet things held to the nose doe breed the fits of the Mother , and on the contrary , stinking things appease those fits ? I answer ; sweet things applyed to the Matrix , in regard that they are hot , doe expell the winde , cut into the slow and tenacious phlegm , and afterwards purge it out : but stinking things applied to the Nose , consume the ascending vapours with their heat ; but you may still demand , if hot stinking things be good to break the winde , why may they not be laid to the Matrix , as well as sweet things ? I answer ? the Matrix embraceth , and meeteth sweet odours and perfumes , but unsavory and stinking sents it abhors , and flies from ; for \\' tis a most certaine truth , that every creature , even by naturall instinct , shunneth inconveniences , and affecteth things convenient . enormous tropical forests , little known to man , and from which he gathers here and there the treasures for our orchid - and greenhouses ; great island conservatories like Java and Ceylon and Borneo , rich in spices and lovely plant life : Australian Bush , with traces of plant life as if from another world , but often most delicate in odour even in the fragments of them we see in our greenhouses . It is not only from the fragile flower-vases these sweet odours flow ; they breathe through leaf and stem , and the whole being of many trees and bushes , from the stately Cum trees of Australia to the sweet Verbena of Chili . Many must have felt the charm of the strange scent of the Boxbush before Oliver Wendell Holmes told us of its ‘ breathing the fragrance of eternity , for this is one of the odours which carry us out of time into the abysses of the unbeginning past . ’ The scent of flowers is often cloying , as of the Tuberose , while that of leaves is often delightful and refreshing , as in the green budding Larch , and in the leaves of Balm and Rosemary , while in many cases fragrance is stored in the wood and permeates down through the roots . To but few it is given to see many of these sweet plants in their native lands , but we who love our gardens may enjoy many of them about us , not merely in drawings or descriptions , but the living , breathing things themselves . The Geraniums in the cottage window bring us the spicy fragrance of the South African hills ; the Lavender bush of the sunny hills of Provence , where it is at home ; the Roses in the garden bring near us the breath of the wild Roses on a thousand hills ; the aromatic pot-herbs of our gardens are a gift of the shore-lands of France and Italy and Greece . The Sweet Bay bush in the farmer ’ s or cottage garden comes with its story from the streams of Greece , where it seeks moisture in a thirsty land along with the wild Olive and the Arbutus . And this Sweet Bay is the Laurel of the poets , of the first and greatest of all poet and artist nations of the earth — the Laurel sacred to Apollo , and used in many ways in his worship , as we may see on coins , and in many other things that remain to us of the great civilisations of the past . 1 The Myrtle , of less fame , was also a sacred plant beloved for its leaves and blossoms , was , like the Laurel , seen near the temples of the race who built their temples as Lilies are built , whose song is deathless , and the fragments of its art Despair to the artist of our time . And so we see how the fragrant bushes our gardens may entwine for us , apart from their gift of fragrance , living associations and beautiful thoughts for ever famous in human story . It is not only these trees and climbers , loved by all for their odour , we have to think of , but many delicate ones , 1 ‘ What you call advantageous , Solon , is for these men to be crowned in view of all the world , who just before were objects of pity from their wounds : and yet it seems they think themselves happy if in return for all their labours they can get a bunch of Laurel . ’ — From the Greek of Lucian . little thought of , perhaps , from the blossoms that give it being without showy colour , as the fragrant American wild Vine . And among these modest flowers there are none more delicate than the blossoms of the White Willow of Britain and northern Europe , all the more grateful in air coming to us . ‘ O ’ er the northern moorland , o ’ er the northern foam . ’ What is the lesson these sweet flowers have for us 1 They tell us — if there were no other flowers to tell us — that a garden should be a living thing ; its life not only fair in form and lovely in colour , but in its breath and essence coming from the Divine . They tell us that the very common attempt to conform these fair lives into tile or other patterns , to clip or set them out as so much mere colour of the paper-stainer or carpet-maker , is to degrade them , and make our gardens ugly and ridiculous , from the point of view of nature or true art . And many of these treasures for the open garden have been shut out of our thoughts owing to exclusion of almost everything that did not make showy colour and lend itself to carpet or other crude modes of setting flowers to compete with tiles and like modes of ‘ decoration . ’ Of the many considerations that should occur in the making of a beautiful garden to live in , this of fragrant plants and flowers is one of the first . And happily among every class of flowers which adorn our open-air gardens , there are odorous things to be found . Apart from the groups of plants in which all , or nearly all , are sweet , as in Roses and Violets , the annual and biennial flowers of our gardens , are rich in fragrance , Stocks , Mignonette , Sweet Peas , Sweet Sultan and Wallflowers , Double Rockets , Sweet Scabious , and many others , the odours of which are not always so popular . These , among the most easily raised of plants , are enjoyed by the simplest cottage gardeners . The garden borders bear for us odours as precious as any breath of tropic Orchid : from the Lily of the Valley to the Carnation — this last being perhaps the most grateful odour of all the flowering host in our garden land . Among these borders one meets with things sweeter than words may tell of — Woodruff , Balm , Pinks , Violets , garden Primroses , Polyanthus , day and other Lilies , early Iris , Narcissus , evening Primroses , Mezereon Bush , Wallflower and Pansies , delicate in their sweetness . No one may be richer in delicate fragrance than the wise man who plants hardy shrubs and flowering trees — Magnolia , Thorn , Daphne , Lilac — names each telling of whole families of delightful things . Among shrubs , those without any very strong odour , like the hardy Heaths , are all the more pleasant to many whose memories are often touched by remembered fragrance of some plant they do not always know . From the same regions where we found the Laurel and the Myrtle we have the Laurustinus , beautiful in all our sea-coast and milder districts , and many other lovely things happy in our climate : one , the Winter Sweet , even pouring out delicious fragrance in mid-winter : Sweet Gale , that grows in any boggy place , Azalea , Allspice , and the delightful little Mayflower that creeps about in the woodland shades in North America . So , though we cannot boast N of Lemon or Orange groves , our climate is kind to many lovely and fragrant shrubs . Even our ugly walls may be sweet gardens with Magnolia , Honeysuckle , Clematis , Sweet Verbena , and the delightful old Jasmine , still clothing many a house in London . Most precious of all , however , are the noble climbing Tea Roses raised in our own time , mostly in France within the past forty years or so . Among the abortions of this century these are a real gain — the loveliest flowers ever raised by man . Noble in form and colour , and scented as delicately as a J une morn in alpine pastures , with these most precious of garden roses we could cover all the ugly walls in England and Ireland , and Heaven knows there are many in want of a veil . The old Kent and Sussex way of having an orchard near the house was a good one . Planted for use , it was as precious for its beauty , and not only when the spring winds carry the breath of its myriad blossoms of Cherry , Plum , Apple , or Pear . We have the fruit odours too , and the faint scent of Strawberries , and later their leaves , and the Currant leaves . It would be , in many places , charming to plant a pretty orchard and have the fruit-garden near or alongside — keeping the less pleasant evidence of vegetables in the background . These beautiful orchards , too , are where the early Daffodils and Snowdrops appear . Then , with Violets and Primroses on the banks they may be delightfully sheltered from the north and east by a grove of our native evergreens — Holly and Yew — these , in their turn , wreathed here and there with the fragrant autumn Clematis , Honeysuckles , and Climbing Wild Roses . Of all the things for garden pictures there are none so good as the lovely groups of hardy trees forming our hardy fruits , including the Medlar and Quince , while near might be the Japanese and other handsome Crabs , which have so much beauty of bloom and also brilliant fruit in autumn . MONO the many enjoyments this fascinating world affords , none are more innocent or enticing than close association with the beautiful gems that so happily grace our gardens , where a balmy atmosphere laden with sweet perfumes and aromatic fragrance , rich and embowering foliage , with rural seclusion , are ever perfect ideas of earthly felicity — ‘ In the calm retreat , Far from the busy haunts of life , Where Flora trains her lovely offspring up To captivate and charm . ’ In all countries , civilised and savage , in the religious festivals of all creeds , and on all occasions whether of grief or rejoicing , the scented attractions of flowers and plants possess an important significance , and Nature seems to have been most bountiful in her munificence in scattering these odoriferous treasures throughout our world , to give cheerfulness to the earth and happiness to its inhabitants . Every rank of people seem equally to appreciate them as a gratification to the organs of sight and smell . The refreshing odours prevalent in a garden , where the richest perfumes shed their aromatic perfections lavishly around , are the spoils from Nature ’ s laboratory , that dispense delicious medicines to sweeten our existence . There are many common flowers to be found growing in our meadows which diffuse a gentle fragrance most gratifying to the senses : and , much as we are concerned with the odour of those flowers and shrubs which are to be met with in our gardens and greenhouses , the wild forms are a source of the keenest pleasure to all . The organisms acting on protein matter aie of economic imfwrtance from several distinct points of view . That organic nitrogenous compounds must be broken down in nature into ammonia and nitrates that they may serve as nutrients to vegetation , is evident . These organisms likewise may interfere with the preservation of food , by changing its consistency , its flavor or odor , or even by producing definite poisonous decomposition products termed ptomaines . The changes in consistency are of jiarticular importance with certain food products , such as cheese , and will be discussed under the general head of ripening processes . The same may be said of the development of desirable flavors . However , the development of undesirable flavors and odors and of ptomaines calls for brief disussion . Putrefactive Substances having Disagreeable Odors and Flavors . — A complete discussion of the compounds capable of affecting the flavor or aroma that may be formed in nitrogenous food would include a discussion of practically all decomposition products formed . A few distinctive products among those most commonly found will be noted . Butyric acid ( C3H7COOH ) and acetic acid ( CH3COOH ) are not uncommonly formed in protein decomposition . In the putrefaction of such foods as meats , it is possible that these may originate from the fats or carbohydrates present rather than from the proteins . Some putrefactive bacteria , however , do form butyric acid from the native proteins . Indol and methyl indol or skatol are commonly formed from native proteins or peptones in the absence of carbohydrates by many organisms . These have an intensely disagreeable fecal odor . Among the most disagreeable of the odors developed is that from the mercaptans , particularly methyl mercaptan ( CH3SH ) . These and certain related compounds containing sulphur are the common causes of the worst odors attendant upon putrefaction . Hydrogen sulphide is also commonly formed , as in rotten eggs . Grooms and Hostlers daily inhale a large quantity of ammoniacal gas generated in the stables . This appears beneficial rather than injurious . They have , moreover , full and varied muscular exertion ; and if they took a more moderate diet , would be almost universally robust . Hostlers , Porters , and under-male servants at inns , are generally sickly , and labour under congestion ( over fulness ) of the vessels in the abdomen and head . Their state evidently results from the ale and spirits they take so frequently . Glue and Size boilers are exposed to strong putrid and ammoniacal exhalations from the decomposition of animal refuse . The stench of the boiling and drying rooms is indeed well known to be highly offensive , even to the neighbourhood . Yet the men declare it agrees well with them — nay , many assert , that on entering this employ , they experienced a great increase of appetite and health . All the glue and size boilers we saw , were remarkably fresh-looking and robust . Though exposed to frequent and considerable changes of temperature , to sudden changes also from an atmosphere of hot vapour to the dry cold air , they are not subject to rheumatism , pulmonary inflammation or catarrh . The only complaints we could hear of , were occasional pains in the loins and hmbs , attributable to posture and exertion . Buckram manufacturers are exposed to the odour of the glue . This is well known to be so great as to offend the neighbourhood of the manufacture . Yet the men make no complaint of ill health , and reach considerable age . Of the seven men employed at the Buckram-house , in Water-lane , one is 51 , another 58 , a third 68 , and the fourth 76 ; and these individuals have been at the employ from an early age . Tallow-chandlers , subjected to an offensive animal odour , enjoy health , and attain a considerable age . During the plague in London it was remarked that this class of men suffered much less than others . Tanners , it is well known , arc subject to disagreeable odours . They work in an atmosphere largely impregnated with the vapour of putrifying skins , and this combined with the smell of lime in one place , and of tan in another . They are exposed constantly to wet and cold . Their feet are scarcely ever dry . Yet they are remarkably robust ; the countenance florid ; and disease almost unknown . t Tanners are said to be exempt from consumption ; and the subject has of late been repeatedly discussed in one of the medical societies of London . We have carefully inquired at several tan-yards , and could not hear of a single example of this formidable disease . We do not find old men actually in the employ ; and the reason assigned is , not the decline of health , but the inferiority of men past middle age , in undergoing the labour of the process . Persons however in advanced life , yet healthy , are found in other occupations , who have before been for many years in the tan-yards , and have not apparently suffered from the long continued exposure to their offensive odour . Hence we may infer that this employ , while it invigorates the constitution in youth and middle age , does not sensibly shorten life ; does not , in other words , give temporary health at the expense of premature decline . Ramazzini tells us , that at Padua the tan-yards were permitted only in the \\' suburbs . Here also , as the stench would be considered a nuisance , tan-yards are at the outskirts . As a matter of medical police , however , we see no occasion for their exclusion from the town . From common joy ; which with the speechless feeling That led her there united , and shot forth From her far eyes a light of deep revealing , All but her dearest self from my regard concealing . Her lips were parted , and the measured breath Was now heard there ; her dark and intricate eyes Orb within orb , deeper than sleep or death , Absorbed the glories of the burning skies , Which , mingling with her heart\\'s deep ecstasies , Burst from her looks and gestures ; and a light Of liquid tenderness , like love , did rise From her whole frame , an atmosphere which quite Arrayed her in its beams , tremulous and soft and bright . She would have clasped me to her glowing frame ; Those warm and odorous lips might soon have shed On mine the fragrance and the invisible flame Which now the cold winds stole ; she would have laid Upon my languid heart her dearest head ; I might have heard her voice , tender and sweet ; Her eyes , mingling with mine , might soon have fed My soul with their own joy . — One moment yet I gazed—we parted then , never again to meet ! Never but once to meet on Earth again ! She heard me as I fled—her eager tone Sunk on my heart , and almost wove a chain Around my will to link it with her own , So that my stern resolve was almost gone . \\' I cannot reach thee ! whither dost thou fly ? My steps are faint—Come back , thou dearest one — Return , ah me ! return ! \\' — The wind passed by On which those accents died , faint , far , and lingeringly . Woe ! Woe ! that moonless midnight ! — Want and Pest Were horrible , but one more fell doth rear , As in a hydra \\' s swarming lair , its crest Eminent among those victims—even the Fear Of Hell : each girt by the hot atmosphere Of his blind agony , like a scorpion stung By his own rage upon his burning bier Of circling coals of fire ; but still there clung One hope , like a keen sword on starting threads uphung All those who have travelled in that season on the coast of Genoa will no doubt remember what charming bouquets and garlands are made of the cassie intermixed with other flowers . To perfumers it is a most valuable assistant , possessing in the highest degree a fresh floral fragrance , which renders it highly useful in compounds . It bears some resemblance to the violet , and , being much stronger , is often used to fortify that scent , which is naturally weak . The cassie requires a very dry soil , well exposed to the sun ’ s rays . The tree does five or six years old . The yield varies from 1 lb . to 20 lbs . for every tree , according to age and position . The blossoms are gathered three times a week after sunrise : a very strong oil and pomade is obtained from them by maceration . In Africa , and principally in Tunis , an essential oil of cassie is made , which is sold at about £4 per ounce ; but French and Italian flowers are not sufficiently powerful to yield an essence . The violet is one of the most charming odours in nature , and well might Shakspeare exclaim — \" Sweet thief , whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells . If not from my lore ’ s breath ? \" It is a scent which pleases all , even the most delicate and nervous , and it is no wonder that it should be in such universal request . The largest and almost only violet plantations have hitherto been at Nice , its exceptional position rendering it the most available spot for them . The species used is the double Parma violet ( Viola odorata ) . It requires a very cool and shady ground , and is generally placed in the orange and citron groves , at the foot of the trees , which screen it with their thick foliage from the heat of the sun . It flowers from the beginning of February to the middle of April , and each plant yields but a few ounces of blossoms , which are culled twice a week after sunrise . Jonquil ( Narcissus jonquila ) , and narcissus ( Narcissus odor at a ) , are two bulbous plants which are also cultivated for perfumery purposes , but in much smaller quantities than any of those already mentioned , their peculiar aroma rendering their use limited . The former is to be found chiefly in the south of France , and the latter in Algeria . Mignonnette , lilac , and hawthorn are also sometimes worked into pomades , but on such a small scale that they are not worth mentioning . The extracts named after those flowers are generally produced by combination . The herbal series comprises all aromatic plants , such as lavender , spike , peppermint , rosemary , thyme , marjoram , geranium , patchouly , and wintergreen , which yield essential oils by distillation . Lavender was extensively used by the Romans in their baths , whence it derived its name . It is a nice , clean scent , and an old and deserving favourite . Curry Powder is ordinarily a mixture of turmeric , black pepper , coriander seeds , cayenne , cardamoms , cumin , fenugreek , ginger , allspice , and cloves . Turmeric , the ingredient furnishing the colouring matter , forms the largest proportion . There is only a small quantity of cayenne , cardamoms , cumin , and fenugreek . Ginger , allspice , and cloves are often omitted . Turmeric powder is obtained from the Curucma longa . The ground turners of the plant are dried and ground to flour . It is said to be adulterated with alkali to heighten the colour , and with yellow ochre . The fruit of the coriander is round , and nearly as large as white pepper . It contains two brown-coloured hemispherical seeds , having an aromatic taste and odour . The seed-vessels , or pods , of cardamom are of triangular form , each containing several hard , reddish-brown seeds , having a pungent taste , and popularly known as \" grains of paradise . \" Cumin and fenugreek seeds are aromatic seeds having a peculiar medicinal taste and odour . The characteristic flavour of curry is due largely to the cumin it contains . Curry has been found to be adulterated with ground rice , potato starch , common salt , red lead , and ferruginous earths . Olive Oil is expressed from olives , the fruit of a well-known tree cultivated in many European countries . Olives should furnish from 20 to 25 per cent , of their weight of oil , but the whole yield is not usually of the same quality . The pure oil is pale yellow , transparent , of agreeable odour and bland taste . It keeps well , being little liable to become rancid . Olive oil is not infrequently adulterated with cotton-seed oil , rape oil , and other cheap vegetable oils . Taking the specific gravity is often sufficient to show there is an adulterant present , and to warrant the food inspector in sending a sample to an expert . The specific gravity of olive oil is 917 - 6 at 59 deg . Fah . Vinegar . — Commercial vinegar is a more or less impure acetic acid . Besides acetic acid it usually contains some alcohol , acetic ether , sugar , gum , various salts , & c , its composition depending to some extent on the substances from which it has been produced . The different varieties of vinegar , according to their source , are malt , wine , cider , beet , sugar , and wood vinegars . Acetic acid is the volatile principle in all , to the presence of which vinegar mainly owes its aroma and pungency . It may be generated by the fermentation of many vegetable and some animal substances . Any vegetable infusion capable of yielding alcohol will furnish vinegar . Let none stand amazed at the pageantry of false Churches , nor value the Whore of Rome because of her bravery . She \\' s deckt with Pearles and precious stones , but smells strong of Aegypt . All the Persumes of Arabia can \\' t hide or choak her stink . \\' Tis not Lateran Musick will consecrate her Masses into audience , nor her incense procure access to the Throne of Grace , I will not smell says the Lord in your Solemn Assemblies . Take away the noise of your Songs , the melody of your Viols , let judgment run down as waters and righteousness like a mighty stream . The Musk Rat . In the Memoirs of the French Academy of Sciences for the year 1725 , there is a complete description of piece of cookery , from Holland . It comes to England in leaden pots , sewed up in canvas : this is of a very deep brick colour , and is assuredly nothing else than blood dried and mixed up with oil and spirit ( tincture ) of true musk . This sort is frequently sold to the perfumers by pretended sailors , at so low a price as two or three shillings per ounce ; whereas , one ounce of true China musk , at sixteen shillings , is by far the cheapest , for this quantity of the true musk is as much as may be supposed to enter into the composition of a whole pound of the other . The true China musk is of the colour of an old brown nutmeg : it is generally rolled up , or contained in the pod , in the form of little round pills , and has a very strong , fine , and agreeable , though singular , smell . The musk imported from China ( which , if possessed of the above characters , is by far the best ) is contained in caddies , or cabinets , in quantities of from 20 to 50 and 100 ounces , each . Some , likewise , is imported from Bengal . The true Russian musk , in pod , mentioned above , is more loose , and has none of the round balls or pills , like that from China . It has also , with its own proper perfume , a very distinguishing smell of urine . As for the other Russian , or rather Dutch musk , in pots ; it is generally very moist and exhales a most disagreeable and predominant ammoniacal smell , whenever the pots are opened . This sort is of so little value , that any thing need hardly be said about it , further , than that it should never be used at all . The Musk Bags , or Pods . When the musk is taken out of the pod , the pod may be cut in very small pieces , or grated very fine by means of a tin grater . This powder will be of great use in several perfumery compositions , as will be afterwards directed ; for it has the odour of the finest parts of the musk , without that of the disagreeable ingredients which may happen to be present . The offensiveness of the several processes described varies from none at all to that which constitutes one of the most intolerable of nuisances . On different occasions the interference or assistance of the Local Government Board have been solicited for the suppression of nuisances from works of this character . The most notable instances of applications of this kind of late years have been in respect of nuisances from manure works along the shores of the Thames in 1873 , and in respect of similar nuisances at Plymouth in 1875 . I reported to the Board fully upon the former of these cases in December 1873 , but more briefly upon the latter of them , since at that time the present general inquiry had been set on foot . It is difficult to describe odours except by the use of similitudes . The offensive odour proceeding from superphosphate works , from works in which animal matters are used more or less freely , and from “ scutch ’ ’ manure works is , however , so distinctive that once smelt it can never afterwards fail to be recognised . That from superphosphate making is pungent and slightly acid ; by some persons it is called sickening , but its offensiveness and sickening quality are enhanced where such animal matters as blood , offal , or fish , especially if putrid , are employed in the manufacture of the manure . I know of no odour more horribly sickening than that which is evolved when sulphuric acid is mixed with human excrement . One of the most offensive works of this kind that has come within my observation , where animal matter of various kinds , and sometimes excrement , are used , is Bradb urn ’ s establishment at Wednesfield , upon which I reported to the Board in my report on the sanitary condition of that place in 1874 . The smell proceeding from scutch manure works is described by some persons as putrid as well as sickening . Dr . Gordon , the principal medical officer of the Woolwich garrison , described to me the odour proceeding from the scutch manure works on Erith marshes as resembling , more than anything else , that which he had perceived in India when passing to leeward of the places in which the Hindoos burn their dead . To myself the odour resembles that of very decayed and putrid cheese . The odour from superphosphate works has to my senses something of the same character , especially marked when animal matters are used in addition to bones and phosphates . The distance to which the offensive odour may spread beyond the works varies with the various circumstances mentioned in the first part of this Report . It may be only perceived offensively within a radius of 100 yards or less around the works , or the odour may extend a mile or more beyond them . For example , the odour from the Avorks of Morris and Griffin at Wolverhampton is said to be perceived offensively at Newbridge , a distance of 1 miles ; Avhile that from the Erith marshes “ scutch ” manure works was , on the occasion of my inquiry on the Thames , saic ) to be an intolerable nuisance at the Woolwich barracks , a distance 4 miles . Loud and grievous complaints are made in the tOAvn of Plymouth , especially by persons residing about the Hoe , of the offensive odours from the manure works at Cattedown , a distance of about 1 mile , when the wind blows from that direction across the bay . I have made such inquiries as were practicable as to the effect of these offensive odours upon the health of persons exposed to them . Replies to individual inquiries have been to the effect that prolonged exposure to the offensive odours produces feelings of depression , headache , indisposition for food , nausea , or even sometimes fainting . These , however , are ordinary results in sensitive individuals of the impression made by any specially offensive odour upon the nervous system . They pass off , however , with the intermission of their cause . I have not been able to ascertain that any permanent injury to health has followed even the frequent repetition of exposure to these offensive odours . Nevertheless , so long as the cause operates it does to a serious extent sometimes disturb the health of some individuals . At the foote of the Mountaine there is a hole , where the vapours with their owne motion , continually cast vp little stones and stinking smelles ; but if any man moue these vapours by a staffe , or any thing put into the hole , the more they are stirred , the greater stones they cast vp , yea flames of fire sometimes . There bee some cottages neere this place , where they make Brimstone , and all these parts smell of brimstone , and if the winde blow from hence towards Naples , the stinke thereof may bee smelled thither . On all sides here be Baths of wholesome waters , which of old were famous . After we had passed huge ruines of old buildings , we came at the foot of a mouaine to the City ( p ) Pozzoli , of old famous , and called Puteolis , to which all these ruines are said to haue belonged of old , and it had the name of the Latin word Puteus , as also it hath the present name from the Italian tong , of the wels , which are frequent . I say it hath the present name of the Italian word Pozzo , signifying a well , though some will haue it named presently of Puzzo , which signifies a stink , because of the smell of britone in these parts : but the city being most ancient , cannot haue the old name of an Itian word : and it is certaine , that the Roman Princes of old vsed this part for the place of their recreation ; for the great sweetnes of the Country , and the plenty of medicinall waters , whereupon they gaue it the first name . Others say that it was of old called Diarchiam , but at this day it is called Pozzoli , or Puzzoli . Here we dined , and were foed to giue our swords to the Host , there being a great penalty set vpon any that carry their Armes . The City hath nothing worth the seeing , but the old Church , first built to Heathen Idols , and after by Christians dedicated to Saint Proculus , and it hath the names of the workemen that built it grauen vpon it , and there be shewed the bones of a Giant of wonderfull bignes . The Hauen of this City was of old very commodious , but by negligence is growne of no vse . Here the sea entring betweene two Mountaines , was of old called the Creeke of ( P ) Baie , of that Citie seated on the opposite shore , or the Creeke of Pozzoli , of this Cie . Suetonius writes that the Emperour Tiberius consulting about his successor , and inclining more to his true Nephew , Thrasyllus the Mathematitian should answere , that Catus should no more raigne , then he should ride ouer the Creeke of Baie . Wherefore Caius being Emperour , and hearing of this diuination ( not as others say , in emulation of Xees , who made a Bridge ouer Hellespont , nor to the end that with the fame of this great worke , he might terrifie the rebellious Germans and Britans ) did build a Bridge ouer this creeke of the sea , being about three miles long , that hee might thereupon passe from Baie to Pozzoli . Of this Bridge thirteene piles of bricke may bee seene neere the shore at Pozzoli , and as many on the other side neere the shore of Baie , and some of these piles haue yet arches vpon them , but ready to fall . And from these piles the Ier part of the bridge was founded vpon two rankes of shippes fastened with ancors , and couered ouer with a bancke of earth , to make the passage like the way of Appius . The rest Suetonius addeth in these or the like words . Ouer this bridge he went to and fro for two daies ; the first day vpon a trapped horse , hauing his head adorned with a Crowne of Oake leaues , and bearing an Hatchet , a Sword , and a Garland , and a robe of cloth of Gold . The next day in a Coch-mans habit , driuing a Coch drawne by foure famous horses , carrying before him Darius a childe , one of the pledges giuen by the Parthians , his Pretorian Souldiers accompanying him , and his friends following him in a Coach , & c . He that desires to compreh the magnificence of this work , must first know , that the Mediterranean sea is very calme , hauing little or no ebbing or flong , and that this Creeke is yet more calme , and that this bridge was built in the furthest part of the Creeke , very neere the land . These things considered , ( if my iudgement faile not ) , there is greater cause of wonder at the Bridge built by the Duke of Parma besieging Antwerp , being in like sort built vpon barkes fastened one to the other , and also at the Bridge of London , bearing a great ebbing and flowing of the sea , and built of free stone , vpon so firme a foundation , as it beareth many great and faire houses vpon it : but whatsoeuer the magnificence were , surely the vanitie of this worke was great , to spend so much vpon this Bridge , the way by land being not a mile longer then by the Bridge . Giue me leaue to digresse so farre , as to remember , that the Territorie of Fernum is not farre from Pozzols , the wine whereof called Falernum , is so much praised by Horace . After dinner we went from Pozzoii , to view the Antiquities lying vpon this Creeke ; and first we came to the Labyrinth , a building vnder ground , which hath the name of the multitude of roomes , with such passages to and fro ; as a man may loose himselfe in them ; and here wee had not onely neede of the thread of Ariadne , but of light also to conduct vs . Leander thinks , that all this building was to keepe fresh water : Then we came to the Amphitheater , being of an Ouall forme , the inner part whereof is 172 foot long , and 88 broad , the building whereof is little ruined : And Suetonius writes , that this was built for the Plaies of Vulcan . Not farre thence , neere the shoare , is a fouaine of cleare and sweete water , flowing plentifully out of the sea , so that for a great distance we might with our eies distinguish the same from the sea water , which Leander thinks to haue been brought by pipes vnder the earth , to these houses of the old Rans . Neere this place are the ruines of many buildings , now called Belgeimano , which the Emperour Tiberius is said to haue built , when hereturned with triumph from the German warre . Betweene the rocks that compasse this sea , is the way Attellane , which leades those that passe to Rome , to the way of Appins , and there be many baths , for most of the waters are medicinall . Neere the Lake of Auernus vpo ? the side towards Pozzoli , lies a Mountaine , ( q ) which lately broke out of the earth , where of old were the bathes of Tripergola , whence the dwellings in this part , and this place , are called Tripergola , and here of old were many large and stately buildings , but by reason of many Earthquakes , and roberies of Pirats , the houses were long since forsaken , and at last in the yeere 1538 were swallowed vp by the earth . For in that yeere vpon Michaelmas day was a terrible Earthquake in this place , which brake out with fire in great flames , casting vp stones , with a great tempest of winde , and darkenesse of the aire , so as the people thought the worlds end was come . And at this time the ashes of this fire were carried by the winde to places twentie miles distant . At last after seuen daies , this confusion ceased , and then the aforesaid Mouaine breaking out of the bowels of the earth was first seene , being three miles high , and at the bottom foure miles compasse . Vpon the toppe of this Mountaine is a hole some fistie paces broad , which towards the bottom growes more and more narrow , where it seemeth round , and of little compasse , hauing a cleare water , yet giuing a stink of britone , and this hole is like a Theater made by art . In the foresaid fearefull Earthquake , caused by the breaking out of the vapours inclosed vnder the hollow earth , many fous bathes were lost , and no more seene . Not farre hence is the Mountaine of Christ , so called , because they say , that Christ with the squadrons of the Fathers , passed this way when hee ascended from Hell . But the French Gentleman Villamont worthily iudgeth this to be fabulous , and likewise the miracle of the Crucifex here , bearing the markes of Christ , yet doth he giue too much credit to the miracles of Loreto . Vpon the shore of the creek of ( r ) Baie , lies the Lake ( as Virgil saith ) of the foule stinng Auernus . This Lake is a naturall Hauen , but is not vsed , because the Hauen of Lrinus is betweene it and the sea . It is compassed with high hils on all sides , but onely where the Sea enters on the South-side at a passage fifty paces broad , and the forme of it is round , and the hils that compasse it now seeme pleasant , but of old were all coued with a thicke wood , which shutting vp the aire , and by the shadow drawing many birds to it , was thought to be the cause that these birds stifled with the smell of britone , fell suddenly dead , till the Emperour Augustus caused the wood to be destroied . And of the birds thus killed , the Lake was called Auernus . For this smell of brimstone , and the shadow of the foresaid wood , darkening the Lake , and the blacke colour of the water , and because the sunne is shut out from the Lake by the hils , this Lake was feined by the Poets to be one of the Lakes of hell . These unspeakable benefits which ye have conceived by the Word , ye are now to receive by the Sacrament , if ye come prepared thereunto : for they who come prepared to participate of these holy mysteries , receive with them and by them , though not in them , the body and bloud of our Lord and Saviour , and thereby shall I say they become flesh of his flesh , and bone of his bone ? nay rather he becommeth flesh of their flesh , and bone of their bone . The spirit which raised him quickneth them , and preserveth in them the life of grace , and them to the life of glory . Howbeit , as the sweetest meats turne intop choler in a distempered stomach , so this heavenly Manna , this food of Angels , nay this food which Angels never tasted , proves no better than poyson to them , whose hearts are not purified by faith , nor their consciences purged by true repentance and charity from uncleannesse , worldlinesse , envie , malice , ranckour , and the like corrupt affections . If a Noble man came to visit us , how would we cleanse and perfume our houses ? what care would we take to have all the roomes swept , hung and dressed up in the best manner ? Beloved Christians , we are even now to receive and entertaine the Prince of Heaven , and the Son of God ; let us therefore cleanse the inward roomes of our soules by examination of our whole life , wash them with the water of our penitent teares , dresse them up with divine graces , which are the sweetest flowers of Paradise , perfume them with most fragrant spices and aromaticall odours , which are our servent prayers , zealous meditations , and elevated affectious , tuned to that high straine of the sweet Singer of Israel , Lift ye up , ye gates , and be yeqlift up , ye everlasting doores , and the King of glory shall come in . Cui , & c . THE REWARD OF PATIENCE . THE LII . SERMON . PHILIP . 2.9 . Wherefore God hath also highly exalted him . Right Honourable , & c . THe drift of the blessed Apostle in the former part of this chapter , to which my Text cohereth , is to quench the fire-bals of contention cast among the Philippians by proud and ambitious spirits , who preached the Gospel of truth not in truth and sincerity , but in faction , and through emulation : ( Phil . 1.15 . ) Some indeed preach Christ out of envie and strife . This fire kindled more and more by the breath of contradiction , and nourished by the ambition of the teachers , and factious partaking of the hearers , Saint Paul seeketh to lave out , partly with his owne teares , partly with Christs bloud , both which he mingleth in a passionate exhortation at the entrance of this chapter : If there be therefore any consolation in Christ , if any comfort of love , if any fellowship of the spirit , if any bowels of mercies ; fulfill yee my joy , bee yee like minded , having the same love , being of one accord , of one mind . Let nothing be done through strife or vaine glory . Look not every man to his owne things , but every man also to the things of others . Let the same mind be in you , which was also in Christ Jesus : who being in the forme of God , thought it no robbery to be equall with God : But made himselfe of no reputation , & c . In this context all other parts are curiously woven one in the other , only there is a bracke at the fifth verse , which seemes to have no connexion at all with the former : for the former were part of a zealous admonition to brotherly love and christian reconciliation , add this to voluntary obedience and humiliation : in those he perswaded them to goe together as friends , in this to give place one to the other : in those he earnestly beseecheth them to be of one mind among themselves , in this to be of the same mind with Christ Jesus . Now peace and obedience , love and humility seeme to have no great affinity one with the other ; for though their natures be not adverse , yet they are very divers . Howbeit , if ye look neerer to the texture of this sacred discourse , ye shall find it all closely wrought , and that this exhortation to humility , to which my Text belongeth , hath good coherence with the former , and is pertinent to the maine scope of the Apostle ; which was to re-unite the severed affections , and reconcile the different opinions of the faithfull among the Philippians , that they might all both agree in the love of the same truth , and seeke that truth in love . This his holy desire he could not effect , nor bring about his godly purpose , before he had beat down the partition wall that was betwixt them : which because it was erected by pride , could be no otherwise demolished than by humility . The contentions among the people grew from emulation among the Pastors , and that from vaine glory . As sparkes are kindled by ascending of the smoake , so all quarrels and contentions by ambitious spirits : theadivisions of Reuben are haughty thoughts of heart . A high conceit of their owne , and a low value and under rate of the gifts of others , usually keep men from yeelding one to the other upon good termes of Christian charity . Wherefore the Apostle , like a wise Physician , applyeth his spirituall remedy not so much parti laesae , to the part where the malady brake forth , as to the cause , the vanitie of the Preachers , and pride of the hearers , after this manner : Christ humbled himselfe , and became obedient unto death , even the death of the Crosse : therefore they who desire to be affected and liked of him , must be like affected to him , and not exalt themselves above others in pride , but rather abase themselves below them in humility ; not behave themselves as lords over the faith of others , but rather demeane themselves as servants for Christs sake ; not pursue ambitiously the glory of this world , but account it the greatest glory to partake with Christ in the infamy of the Crosse . How unfit and incongruous a thing is it in contention to preach the Gospel of peace ? in rage and choler to treat of meeknesse ? in malice and hatred to exhort to Christian love and reconciliation ? in pride to commend humility ? in vaine glory to erect the Crosse of Christ ? that is to deny the power of it in so declaring it . Yet if they will needs bee ambitious , if their affections are so set upon glory and honour that nothing can take them off , let them take the readiest course to compasse their desire , which lyeth not in the higher way they have chosen , by advancing themselves , but in the lower way , which Christ took by abasing himselfe . For glory is of the nature of a Crocodile , which flyeth from them that pursue it , and pursueth them that flie it , as S.bChrysostome excellently declareth it : Glory ( saith he ) cannot be attained but by eschuing it ; if thou makest after it , it maketh away from thee ; if thou flyest from it , it followeth thee ; if thou desirest to be glorious , be not ambitious ; for all truly honour them who affect not honour : as on the contrary they hold a base opinion of such as are ever aspiring to honour , and that for the most part without desert . Two weighty reasons wee have in this verse to incline all Christian minds to obedient humility or humble obedience , a patterne of it and the reward thereof : he humbled himself so low , therefore God exalted him so high . Of the patterne most lively drawne in the life and especially the death of our Saviour , I have said something already , and shall more hereafter ; yet can never say all . As Socrates spake of Philosophy , that it was nothing but meditatio mortis , a meditation upon death , we may of Divinity , that it is in a manner nothing else but meditatio mortis Christi , a meditation on Christs death : for the learnedest of all the Apostles would be knowne of no other knowledge that he had , or much esteemed but this , Icdesire ( saith he ) to know nothing but Jesus Christ , and him crucified.dPliny describeth unto us a strange kind of people in Africa , that had no mouthes , but received all their nourishment at their nostrils ( which is nothing else but sweet smells and fragrant odours ) who if they are to take any long journey , provide themselves of great store of flowers , and sweet wood , and aromaticall spices , lest they starve by the way . I will not warrant the narration , because I know it is a case over-ruled in Aristotles philosophy , that smells nourish not ; but the application I can make good out of the Apostle , who calleth the Gospel and the Preachers thereof odorem vitae ad vitam , a savour ofelife unto life . Though the naturall life be not , yet the spirituall is nourished by odours & savours . And howsoever we are not in our bodies , yet in our soules we are Astomi , and , like those people of Africa , receive nourishment from sweet trees and roots . The sweet root we are alwayes to carry about us , is the root of the flower of Jesse : the savoury wood we are to smell unto , is the wood of the Crosse , that is , the tree of life in the midst of our Paradise . It is the ladder of Jacob whereby we ascend into heaven , it is the rod of Aaron that continually buddeth in the Church , it is the Juniper tree whose shade killeth the Serpent , it is the tree which was cast into the waters of Marah and made them sweet : no water so bitter , no affliction so brackish , to which the Crosse of Christ giveth not a sweet rellish . These lodgings have spaces , like streets , between them , large enough to give the bees a free passage in and out ; and yet narrow enough to preserve the necessary heat . The mouth of every cell is defended by a border , which makes the door a little less than the inside of the cell , which serves to strengthen the whole . These cells serve for different purposes : for laying up their young ; for their wax , which in winter becomes a part of their food ; and for their honey , which makes their principal subsistence . It is well known that the habitation of bees ought to be very close ; and what their hives want , from the negligence or unskilfulness of man , these animals supply by their own industry : so that it is their principal care , when first hived , to stop up all the crannies . For this purpose they make use of a resinous gum , which is more tenacious than wax , and differs greatly from it . This the ancients called Propolis : it will grow considerably hard in June ; though it will in some measure soften by heat ; and is often found different in consistence , colour and smell . It has generally an agreeable aromatic odour when it is warmed ; and by some it is considered as a most grateful perfume . When the bees begin to work with it , it is soft , but it acquires a firmer consistence every day ; till at length it assumes a brown colour , and becomes much harder than wax . The bees carry it on their hinder legs ; and some think it is met with on the birch , the willow , and poplar . Section 1 . PHYSICK FOR THE SICKNESSE . THe word Plague in English , signifieth , A Sharpe Punishment of what kind soever . As we may reade many were the Plagues inflicted on the Egyptians : and some of us in Indignation wil threaten to plague those that highly offend us . But it is usually and most properly taken for that dreadfull affliction which in Latin is called Pestis , or Pestilentia ; in Greeke in non-Latin alphabet , which signifies A Deadly Fretting , and it is the same with in non-Latin alphabet a in non-Latin alphabet , quod efficiat Defectum Hominum . Or in non-Latin alphabet , Pernities seu Exitium . Hippocrates gives it a name of distinction , calling it in non-Latin alphabet , Morbus Communis , a Common or popular Disease . But we must understand that there are two sorts of Plagues that be Epidemicall . Viz . A Simple , and a Putrid Plague . The Simple Plague , is The very Influence of the striking Angell executing the vengeance of God upon the Bodies of Men . This kind of Plague ariseth from no distemper of Blood , putrifaction of Humors , or influence of Starres ; but falleth meerely from the immediate stroke of Gods punishing Angell ( Such were the Plagues , Exod . 12 Num . 11.16.25 . Also , 2 Sam . 24 . and 2 Kings , 19 . ) whereof some dye suddenly without any precedent complaint or conceit of Infection . Others againe , though they be sicke before they dye ; yet their first taking hath beene after an extraordinary manner . For I observed in the last great Plague heere in London , ( Anno 1625 . ) That some felt themselves manifestly stricken , being sensible of a blow suddainly given them , on the Head , necke , backe , or side : Sometime so violently , that they have been eyther almost , or altogether over-turned : and after these and such like stroakes some have dyed , and those that recovered , escaped without humane helpe : For this kind of Plague , as it is rare , so it is also by all Art of Man incurable . Therefore no Method but Repentance , no Medicine but Prayer , can avert , or heale this stroake : Of all Antidotes for the Body , that Triacle which is made of the Flesh of earthly Serpents , is the best esteemed : But for the Soule , that only which is made of the Bloud of that Brazen Serpent that was lifted vp on the Crosse for our sinnes . Hee that by a lively Faith applyeth the benefit of our Blessed SAVIOURS Sufferings to the sicknesse of his Soule , shall undoubtedly recover ( if not health here ) heaven hereafter . The Putrid Plague , is a Popular Feavor venemous and Infectious , striking chiefly at the Heart , and for the most part is accompanied with some Swelling , which is eyther called a Blayne , a Botch or a Carbuncle , or else with Spots called GODS Tokens . This comes of Putrifaction of the Bloud and Humors in the Body , which it pleaseth God sometimes to make the Instrument of his punishing Iustice , mixing it with the Simple Plague before mentioned . This Putrifaction may be caused by the Influence of the Starres , who doe undoubtedly worke upon all sublunarie bodies . For Astrologers are of opinion , that if Saturne and Mars have dominion ( especially under Artes , Sagitarius , and Capricorn , ) a Pestilence is shortly to be expected . Or if these two ( the most Malevolent ) be in Opposition to the gentle Planet Iupiter ; as the Poet singeth : — Caelitús imbuitur tabe aifflatilis aura Mars quando obijcitur Falcitenens { que } Iovi . The Windes likewise are led into theyr motions by the motions of the Starres ; The Planets ( especially the Sunne ) by extracting the earths exhalations ( which are the substance of the Winds ) doe set them so on worke . And the Windes are some by nature wholsome , and some unwholsome . The South-wind blowing from the Meridian is of nature hot and moyst , and full of showers . Now when by the influence of the Planets this Wind bloweth long and bringeth continuall raine , it causeth much moysture in all Airie and Earthy bodies , and so much the more by how much the milder it is . This moysture being in such abundance cannot be digested nor attenuated by the Sunnes heat ; and therefore setling together it must needs putrifie ; and that so much the sooner , because the heate of the Sunne ( not being able to extract all ) does inflame the remnant , by which inflamation the putrifaction becomes the greater . In this manner are the windes in cause : and moreover they doe sometimes transferre the Contagion from one region to another ; as Hippocrates affirmes the Plague to be brought over the Sea from Aethiopia into Greece , by the South-wind . Now if the Starres be pestilently bent against us , neyther Arts nor Armes , Perfumes nor Prayers , can prevaile with them , who have neyther pitie nor sense , nor power to alter their appointed motions . But Hee that commandeth their course , and altereth them at his pleasure : Hee that made the Sunne and Moone to stand still for Iosuah , yea drew the Sunne tenne degrees backe for Hezekiah , and caused the Starres to fight in their courses against Sisera . He , and He onely is able to heale all infections that can arise from their influences . The Cure of this Cause therefore is the same with the former . Other Causes there be also of this Putrid Plague . Namely , corrupt and unwholsome Feeding , stenches of unsavorie and rotten Dung-hils , Vaults , Sinckes , Ditches and dead Carions ; as the Poet affirmes ; — Corpora faeda iacent , vitiantur adoribus aurae . These are the Maintaining Causes of the Contagion after it is begun . So is likewise the unseasonablenesse of the Weather : Quum tempestiva intempestivè redduntur : as sayth Hippocrates , When the weather is unseasonable for the season of the yeare ; being hot when it should be cold , moyst when it should be dry : and on the contrary . This kind of Plague is by Art curable in as many as it pleaseth GOD to send and sanctifie the right meanes unto . The former is most properly called The Plague , being the immediate Stroke of Gods hand . This , The Sicknesse , because infectious , and many times Curable . For this therefore doe I intend to prescribe a course of Physicke , such as both my much reading , and also my manifest Experience in the last great Visitation , have preferred to my best approbation . Wherein I will first open the way of Preservation , after that , shew the Signes of being Infected , and then the Course of Cure . In the way of Preservation , it is first necessary to be considered , whether it be Infectious or no : And then who are most or least subject ( according to naturall reason ) to receive this Infection . This Putrid Plague , is ( as I have sayd ihe Definition ) venemous , which is granted of all both Physitians and Philosophers . Now by Venom or Poyson , we commonly understand some thing that has in it some dangerous subtle quality that is able to corrupt the substance of a living body to the destruction or hazard of the life thereof . This working is apparent in this Sicknesse , by his secret and insensible insinuation of himself into the Vitall spirits , to which as soone as hee is gotten , he shewes himselfe a mortall enemy , offering with suddaine violence to extinguish them . His subtle entrance , his slye crueltie , his swift destroying ; the unfaithfulnesse of his Crisis , and the other Prognostick signes ; and the vehemencie , grievousnesse and ill behaviour of his Symptomes , all being manifest proofes of his venemous quality . For in this Disease the Seidge , Vrine , and sweat , have an abhominable savour , the breath is vile and noysome : Ill coloured Spots , Pustles , Blisters , swellings , and vlcers full of filthy matter arise in the outward parts of the Body : Such as no superfluitie or sharpnesse of Humors , nor any putrifaction of matter ( without a venemous qualitie joyned with it ) can possibly produce . But though it may thus by the Learned be acknowledged to be Venemous ; yet is it by many of the Ignorant sort conceited not to be Infectious . To satisfie such , I define Infection or Contagion to be That which infecteth another with his owne qualitie by touching it , whether the medium of the touch be Corporeall or Spirituall , or an Airie Breath . Of this kind there are divers Diseases that are infectious , though not so deadly as the Plague . As for Example , Itch and Scabbinesse , Warts , Measels , small Pox , the Veneriall Pox ; these by rubbing , and corporeall touches doe infect : Also soare Eyes doe by their Spirituous beames infect other eyes : And the Pthisick or putrified Lungs doe by their corrupt breath infect the lungs of others . But the Plague infects by all these waye , and such sicke bodies infect the outward Aire , and that Aire again infects other Bodies . For there is a Seminarie Tincture full of a venemous quality , that being very thin and spirituous mixeth it selfe with the Aire , and piercing the pores of the Body , entreth with the same Aire , and mixeth it selfe with the Humors and spirits of the same Body also . For proofe of this , we see by daily experience , that Garments , Coffers , nay walls of Chambers will a long time retaine any strong sent , wherwith they have beene fumed . Now the Sent is meerly a Qualitie , and his substance is the Aire , which is also the Vehiculum wherein it is seated and conveighed . So does the Pestilent Infection take hold , though not sensibly ( for the strongest Poysons have little taste or smell ) yet certainly ; as experience testifies : for Garments , and Houshold-stuffe have beene infected , and have infected others . As Fracastorius tels of a Furred-Gowne , that was the death of 25 . Men in Verona , Anno 1511 . who one after another wore it , thinking still they had ayred it sufficiently . And if Alexander Benedictus may be beleeved , Feather-beds will keepe the Contagion seaven yeares . Other experiences we have also of live Poultry , which being applyed to the soares , are taken away dead , having not been wounded , crushed , nor hurt any whit at all . And many that have beene Infected , have plainly perceived where , and of whom they tooke it . [ Object . ] But ( say some ) then why is not one infected as well as another I have eaten of the same dish , drunk in the same cup , and lyen in the same bed with such sicke ones , and that while their Soares were running : yet never had so much as my finger aking after it . [ Answ . ] To this I answer , there may be Two speciall Causes for this . The first and Principall Cause is the Protection of the Almighty , which preserves some as miraculously as his Iustice strikes others . Thus through his Mercy he often preserves those that with faithfull and conscionable care doe Christian offices about the Sicke ; being warrantably called thereto , and not thrusting themselves eyther presumptuously , or rashly into the businesse without a just , and reason-rendring Cause . For GOD has given his Angels charge over vs , to keepe vs in all our wayes , as the Psalmist sings . And secondly , every pestilent Contagion is not of the same nature , nor hath equall conformity with every Constitution , Age , or manner of Living : For some Contagion is apt to infect onely the Sanguin complexion , some the Cholericke , some the Phlegmaticke onely : Some Children , some Youths , some those of Ripe age , some Antient people ; some the Rich , and other the poore onely : And where the Seminarie Tincture hath no Analogie , there is none , or verie flight Infection . And first those are most apt to be Infected , that have thin Bodyes and open pores ; and whose hearts are so hot , that they need much attraction of Aire to coole them . Also , they whose Veynes and Vessels , are full of grosse humors , and corrupt juyces ( the venemous matter being thicke , and therefore unapt to breath through the pores ) their putrefaction is increased by the inward heat , and so driven to malignitie ; and thence onward to a Pestilent qualitie . Hence those bodies that are moist and full of Phlegmaticke humors , whose veines are straight ( and therefore apter to intercept then entertaine those well well concocted juyces that would make the purest Bloud ) and the thicknesse of whose skin denies the transpiration of excrements : these are easily poluted and infected . Section 2 . Repletion and Evacuation . Exercise and Rest . Sleepe and Watching . Passions of the Minde . They are composed also in these two Verses . Aër , Esca , Quies , Repletio , Gaudia , Somnus : Haec moderata juvant , immoderata nocent . These indeed are the sixe Strings of Apollo \\' s Viall , wherein consisteth the whole harmonie of health . If these be in tune , the body is sound : But any of those too high wrested , or too much slackned ( that is immoderately used ) makes a discord in nature , and puts the whole body out of tune . For Ayre first . Ayre is that which we draw in with our breath continually , and wee cannot live without it one minute ; for it is the food of our Spirits , and therefore we had need take heed that the ayre we draw be pure and wholsome . The whole streame of Opinion runnes upon a cold and dry Aire , so commending the North and East windes , as most wholsome : and condemning the Hot and Moist Aire engendred by the South and West windes , as the fittest matter for infection , because most apt to putrefaction . So Hippocrates ( in the 2d . of his Epidem . ) saith , that in Cranon a Citie of Thessalie , there arose putrid Vlcers , Pustuls , and Carbuncles , through the hot and moyst constitution of the ayre . And Galen ( in 1 . de Temperam . c . 4 . ) affirmeth , that the hot and moyst constitution of the ayre , doth most of all breed pestilent diseases . And from these mouthes , a multitude of late Writers have learnt to speake the same thing . Yet we know that the hot and dry weather also , may cause a contagious ayre . So saith Avenzoar in his 3 . Booke , 3 . Tract . and 1 . chap . And Titus Livius ( in lib . 1 . decad . 4 . ) recordeth , that Rome was infected with the Plague by a Hot and Dry distemper of the Aire . Wee also may remember , that the Summer 1624 was an extreame dry and parching Summer : and we cannot forget that this last Summer was not much unlike like it . The Contagion indeed this yeare was begotten beyond Sea , and was rock \\' d hither in sicke bodyes ; but our Ayre I feare will prove a Nurse though not a Mother to it : This Spring answering to the sore-past Summer in heate and drouth . Now to avoyde the mischiefes of unwholsome ayre ; Hippocrates the Prince of Physitians , ( in his Booke de Natura humana ) gives this counsell . Providendum est ut quàm paucissimus aëris influxus corpus ingrediatur , & ut ille ipse quam peregrinus existat : Regionum etiam locos in quibus morbus consistat , quantum ejus fieri potest permutare oportet . Others advise in threee words . Citò , Longè , Tardè , which Iordanus calls an Antidote made of 3 . adverbs , thus versifying upon them . Haec tria tabificam pellunt adverbia Pestem ; Mox , Longè , Tardè ; Cede , recede , redi . But I will not teach to flee ; for too many with Dedalus put on wings the last great visitation , that with Icarus dropt downe by the way . Onely my counsell is this . Let every one keepe himselfe as priuate as he may : Shun throngs of people , and all wet , close , and stinking places . Walke not abroad before , nor after Sunne . Keep moderation between heat and cold in all things ; yet rather encline to heate a little , because of drying up superfluous moystures . Let the streets bee kept cleane ; washing the channels every morning and evening , and sweeping away all durt , leaves , stalkes , and rootes of hearbes , and offals ; leaving no dunghils nor other noysome matter in the streets . Also in the evenings it is good to purifie the ayre with Bonefires , but especially with Fireworkes : or rather with discharging of peeces : for Gunpowder is exceeding drying by reason of the Salt peeter and Sulphur with which it is made , and by the crackes that it gives , the Ayre is forcibly shaken and attenuated , and so opened to let in that purification , which is immediately made by the fire that goes along with it . This way is commended by Levinus Lemnius , de Ocultis Naturae Mirac . lib . 2 . cap . 10 . Also by Crato in consilio 275 By Raymundus Mindererus lib . de Pestilentia cap . 20 . and all the late Writers . Within doores observe , that little houses must not be pestered with many Lodgers , for it is best ( for those that are able ) to have shift of Beds and Chambers to lie in , that the ayre in them may be kept free and sweet . Keepe every roome daily very cleane , leaving no fluts corners . Let not Water stand so long in any vessell as to putrifie ; which in hot weather it will soone doe . Make Fires every day in everie roome , in quantitie according to the largenesse of the roome , and the temperature of the weather . Perfume them and all the houshold-stuffe in cold and moist weather with Frankinsense , Storax , Benjamin , Pitch , Rosin , Lignum alöes , Lignum Rhodium , Iuniper-wood , or the Berries . In hot and drie weather with Rosewater on a hot Fire-shovell , or some such like coole fume in a perfuming-pot . Strew the Windowes and ledges with Rew , Wormwood , Lavender , Marjoram , Penyriall , Costmary , and such like in cold weather ; but in hot with Primroses , Violets , Roseleaves , Borrage , and such cooling scents . For Garments , avoide ( as much as may bee ) all leather , woollen , and furres : also velvets , plush , and shagge . Choose such as may be watered , as chamlets , grograms , paropas , philip and chenyes , and such like : for their gumminesse excludeth the infectious aire best . Have shift , and shift often ; and still as cloathes are left off , perfume them well . Beware of buying old clothes , Bedding or such like stuffe : for if they have beene used by the infected , they are verie dangerous , as I told you before in the authoritie of a furr \\' d Gowne , and Feather-beds . Carrie in your mouth a peece of Citron-pill , or for want of that , of Lemon pill ; a Clove , or a peece of Tormentill Root . Or if any will resort to me in Golding lane , I will soone provide for them Lozenges to hold in their mouth , sit for their constitution , and such as I have had good experience of , the last great Plague time . Carry in your hand a Lemon stucke with cloves , sweet Marjoram , Lavender , Balme , Rew , or Wormwood ; as the constitution of your braine shall require . For beleeve by my experience , that many did enflame their braines , and so fell into the Sicknesse they shunned in the last great Contragion , by smelling to , and carrying things in their mouthes too hot for their complexion.Camphor also , though it be accounted an excellent coole fume for ill aires , yet those that have cold and weake stomacks are very much weakned by the use of it . But beware of unsavourie smels and stinking odours . For though Dioscorides commends Galbanum , and Cardan the burning of Leather , Averroes a potion of Vrine , and others the smelling to Horse-dung : yet I stand to it , that sweet and pleasing odours are more proper ; because they dilate , restore and comfort the Spirits ; whereas the contrary doe contract , and repugne them ; and so weaken the faculties . I intend to have also preservative waters to dip Spunges in for severall Constitutions , to be carried in Boxes to smell to : As also , preservative Pomanders of choyse vertue . The next point of Dyet , is Meat and Drinke . Let your meate be alwayes good and sweet , temperate betwixt hot and cold , and not too moyst or fleshie : easie of digestion , and such as makes the best Bloud . Such are Beefe , Mutton , Lambe , Kid , and Cony . Turkey , Capon , Pullet , Partridge , Pheasant , Pigeons , Turtles , Larkes , Black-birds , Thrushes , and Finches . All Water-fowles are naught . The Hearts of Red and Fallow Deere , are speciall good : so also are those of young Steeres , Calves , Kids , and Lambes : beeing cordiall , both by reason of Sympathy , and solidnesse of the flesh , which causeth them to be the lesse corruptible . Of Fish , ( which should be eaten but seldome , though it be of the best kinde ) the elected are fresh Salmon , Trout , Barbell , Shrimps , Playse and Flounders , ( when they are firme , not flashy ) Smelts , Makarell , Gudgion , Mullet , Soale , Gurnard , Lobster , and Cray-fish . But Eeles , Lamperns , and Lampreys , with all such as delight in Mud , are to bee avoyded . Egges of Hennes and Turkeys , are good . Oyle and Butter , are kindes of Antidotes against venome ; and Butter-milke may now and then be used by hot Constitutions . Fruites must be eaten but sparingly . Those that wee may be most bold withall , are sowre Cherries ; Plums , and Gooseberries before they be full ripe , having a sowre taste . Also Peaches , Quinces , Pomgranads , Oranges , Limons , Medlars , Services , Mulberries , Raspes , Strawberries , and Currans , which being not full ripe are astringent , but ripe doe loosen the body . But of Walnuts , Filbers , and Small-nuts , the elder are the better Dryed Fruits also are good , whether they bee Peares , Plums , Cherries , Figs , Raisons , or Prunes . Moreover , Pease , Beanes , and Artichokes , may be used sometimes by leane and spare Bodies . If other Fruits that are colder and moyster bee longed for ; eate after the man Orange with a little fennell and salt . The best Rootes are Onions , Leekes , and Radishes , for these are vertuous against venome . But they offend hot heads , and weake eyes . Of Herbes ; Rue , Wormwood , Balme , Mints , Pennyryall , Rosemary , Sage , sweet Marjorum , and Time . For Sallets and Sauces , Burrage , Buglosse , Violets , Fennell , and especially Sorrell ; Olives also , and Capers . Vineger , Verjuice , juice of Limons and Oranges ; which for their drynesse resist putrifaction , and for their coolnesse , Feavors . But those colder stomackes that are offended with them , may temper them with Wine and Spices . Yet there must be cautious usage of hot spices , and all salt meates , lest they inflame the Bloud ; though in regard of their drying and heating quality they be usefull in some bodies , and at some times ; especially for cold and waterish stomackes : Others must mixe them with Vineger , Verjuice , or the juice of Limons or Oranges . Note here , That Vineger is of a speciall vertue against putrifaction , as AMBROSE PAREY in the 8 . Chapter of his Booke of the Plague proveth , by the use of it in washing dead bodies with it before they are Embalmed , that they may keepe sweet the longer . But it is not so good for Women , because it offends the Mother ( as CRATO affirmeth , Consil . 275 . ) therefore they must allay it with white Wine and Sugar . Note also , that Cabbages , Coleworts , Lettuce , Pompions , Musk-Mellons , and Coucumbers , are very dangerous meates in contagious times ; neither doe I approve of any other rootes , then Garlicke , for rusticke bodies ; and for others Onions , Leekes , and Radishes ( as I said before ) onely . Roasting is the best way of dressing Flesh , and Frying or Broyling of Fish . Broths are but for Sicke and weake ones fit : And then they must be sharpned with a little Vineger , or juice of Lemmons . For ( as MANARDUS sayes , lib . 5 . Epist . 3 . ) the body ought rather to be dried then moystened . And so then for Drinke , it must be as little as may well be borne ; good and pure , whether it be Beere , Ale , or Wine , ( for Mede , Vsquba { que } , Bragget , & c . I account them rather Medicines then parts of Food ) But neither heady , too sweet , nor too small . To a weake stomacke and a feeble Nature , Wine is an Antidote against all Poysons ; as CELSUS lib . 8 . de Re Medica cap . 27 . affirmeth . And Senectutis summa est medicina , as ATTIUS teaches , Tetr . 1 . serm . 4 . cap . 30 . But let not those that are young and strong , make a common use of them in Contagious times : For it must needs breed Inflamation , after which followes Putrifaction , which is a fit host to entertaine such an ill guest as the Pestilence . Wheaten-Bread of a Day old , and a little leavened is absolutely the best for healthy people . Light Biskets also with Anise-seeds is very good . For the strict Quantitie of Eating and Drinking , I cannot stint every mans stomacke ; but must conclude with HIPPOCRATES , Aph . 17 . lib . 1 . Concedendum est aliquid Tempori , Regioni , Aetati , & Consuetudini . The Season , Place and Custome , must beare some sway in these things . Only beware of Sacietie or Glutting : For the same Hippocrates in his 17th . Aphorisme , in the 2 , Booke . Sayes , that Meate and Drinke immoderately taken , causeth Sicknesse . For from thence arise Crudities , which ( sayth GALEN , in Comm . 2 . in Hippocr . de Natur . Humana ) breed new Diseases . Therefore hearken to AVICEN , Who adviseth alwayes to rise from Meate with some remainder of appetite : for within halfe an houre , or thereabouts , as soone as the meate first eaten beginneth to digest , our hunger ceaseth . lib . 1 . Fen . 3 . Doct . 2 . cap 7 . And hence it is , that some ( greedily following the sense of their appetite-onely ) over-charge their stomackes even to vomiting , before they feele themselves satisfied : because though the vessell be over-full , yet appetite is not apprased till Concoction have begun her worke upon some part of that which is already received . Section 3 . Lazinesse encreaseth superfluous humours , and over-violent labour , wasteth away the nourishing ones . But moderate exercise ( ad ruborem non ad sudorem ) stirreth up and nourisheth Naturall heate , helping Concoction and Evacuation ; if also it be used in seasonable times and convenient places . The best Exercise is walking with a little stirring of the armes . The Time , in the morning : and the place , eyther in a pure ayre abroad , or in a purified ayre at home , in some large roome , where is little or no company , by the heate of their bodies and breaths , to distemper the Aire . But at all times beware of taking cold ; for great colds and rheumes doe easily putrid Feavors , and they as easily prove Pestilent . Sleepe and Watching is the fifth point . Sleepe eyther immoderate or unseasonable , hindereth digestion , and causes crudities , quels the vitall and dulls the Animall Spirits . Watching also over-much , dries up and inflames the good Bloud , and weakens all the powers of Nature . Let your sleepe therefore be seasonable , and not superfluous . Not upon your dinner , unlesse custome commands it ; and then take it but vapping for halfe an houre or so , sitting in a Chaire upright . Three houres at least after a light Supper goe to Bed ; where let five or sixe houres suffice for sleepe . Lye conveniently warme , the Chamber dores and windowes being shut to exclude the night ayre . But beware of sleeping or lying on the ground or grasse : for the nearer the earth the more deadly is the Aire . And the immediate stroake of the cold vapors rising from the ground is dangerous at all times . The Sixt Point of Diet , is Passions of the Mind . All kindes of Passion , if they be vehement , doe offer violence to the Spirits ; yea though they be of the better and more naturall sort . As Laughter ( if unbridled ) doth runne even life out of breath , and greatly perplexeth the Body : in so much as the brest and sides are pained , the breath is straitned , and sometimes the Soule it selfe , is ( as I may say ) laughed out of her skin . For so it is recorded of CHRYSIPPVS , That onely upon the sight of an Asse eating Figges , he brake into such an unmeasurable laughter , that he fell downe and dyed . Section 4 . There is commonly , 1 Trembling of the heart , fainting or sowning . 2 A Feavor , though not easily discerned at first . 3 Cardialgia , commonly called Heart-ache . 4 Vomiting , and Loathing in the stomacke . 5 Extreame Thirst , and vile taste in the Mouth . 6 Head-ache , and pricking paines there . 7 Swimming , or Vertigo . 8 Losse of Memorie , and Foolish behaviour . 9 Want of sleepe . 10 Delirium , or Frenzy . 11 Convulsions , or Cramps . 12 Lethargie , or extreame Drowsinesse . 13 Sharp paines in the Eares . 14 Opthalmia , or inflamation of the Eyes . 15 Bleeding at the Nose . 16 The tongue and mouth enflam \\' d and furr \\' d . 17 Spitting of Bloud . 18 Squinansie . 19 Pleuresie . 20 Very short Breath , and continuall sighing . 21 Drye Cough . 22 Iaundise . 23 Swelling of the Belly with externall paine . 24 Colick , and Iliak Passions . 25 Extreame Costinesse . 26 Wormes . 27 Flux of the Belly : eyther Lieuteria , or Diarrhaea . 28 Bloudy Flux . 29 Swelling of the Testicles very painefully . 30 Suppression of Vrine . 31 Extreame heate , and paine in the Backe . 32 Swelling of the Feet and Legges with intollerable paine . 33 And sometimes , Such immoderate Sweat horribly stinking , that it affrights the Physitian from his course of sweating the Patient , and yet for all this sweat the deadly danger increaseth . And not one of these Symptomes can bee cured by the common Method of such cases : Because of the venemous quality that is mixed with them . When I had well informed my selfe of these things , and saw how little they were regarded of others . I was stricken with wonder to see , with what peaceable consciences some men went a killing . And I began to doubt whether it were not better for a man to be at peace with Ignorance , then to carry his trembling heart in his hand , as I did al that time . Yet then it pleased God to blesse my labours and counsailes , and to let a very small number faile under my advice . Why ? you may as reasonably expect to preserve your health in a Pest-house , as your Chastity in that damn \\' d lascivious Town . Luc . You are rude , Sir . Clodp . Come , Madam , plain dealing is a jewel . But can you prefer an idle scandalous London-life , before a prety innocent huswifely-life in the Country to look to your Family , and visit your Neighbours . Luc . To see my Ducks and Geese fed , and cram my own Chickens . Clodp . Ay . Luc . To have my Closet stink like a Pothecaries shop with Drugs and Medicines , to administer to my sick Neighbours ; and spoil the next Quacks practice with the receipt book that belongs to the family . Clodp . Very well . Luc . And then to have one approv \\' d Green-salve , and dress sore legs with it ; and all this to deserve the name of as good a neighbourly body as ever came into Sussex . Clodp . Very good . Luc . Never to hear a Fiddle , but such as sounds worse than the Tongs and Key , or a Gridiron ; never to read better Poetry , than Iohn Hopkins , or Robert Wisdoms vile Metre ; nor hear better singing than a company of Peasants praising God with doleful untunable hoarce voices , that are only fit to be heard under the Gallows . Clodp . However you make bold with the Country , be not prophane . Is not this better than any thing in that stinking Town ? Luc . Stinking Town ! I had rather be Countess of Puddledock , than Queen of Sussex . Clodp . Oh foh — but ah , the excellent fresh air upon the Downs . 320 . Italian Snuffs Put into a mortar , or other convenient vestel , a quantity of Snuff already scented with some Flower , pour on it a little White Wine , and add , if agreeable , some Essence of Ambergrise , Musk , or any other Perfume you like best ; stir the Snuff and rub it well between your hands . Scent Snuff in this manner with any particular flavour , and put the different scented Snuffs in separate boxes , which are to be marked , to prevent mistakes . 321 . Snuff scented after the Spanish Manner Take a lump of double-refined Sugar , rub it in a mortar with twenty grains of Musk ; add by little and little a pound of Snuff , and grind the whole with ten grains of Civet , rubbing it afterwards well between your hands . Seville Snuff is scented with twenty grains of Vanilloes only . Keep your Snuff in canisters closely syopped , to prevent the scent from exhaling . As Spanish Snuff is very fine and of a redish colour , to imitate it nicely , take the best Dutch Snuff , well cleansed , granulated , and coloured red ; beat it fine , and sift it through a very fine lawn sieve . After it has been cleansed according to the foregoing directions , it is fit to take any scent whatever . There is no rilk in using a sieve that retains the scent of any Flower , to perfume your Snuff with the flavour of Musk , Ambergrise , or any other Perfume . On the contrary , the Snuff receives the Perfume the more readily , and preserves its flavour the longer on that account . Section1 . In the first place , I am of opinion that the complaints made by the inhabitants of Charlton and the adjoining parishes , and by the Sanitary Committee of the Woolwich garrison , of offensive smells , are well foimded . Two varieties of odour were described to me , both of which were said to be sickening , but the one more distinctly acid than the other , and the one or the other was said to be perceived according to the direction of the wind . But all parts of the district from which the complaints issued do not suffer equally from both varieties of odour . It appeared further , that the more elevated parts , at a greater or less distance from the shore of the river , sutler more than those parts which are situated at a lower level and nearer to the shore . The description given me by the Commandant at Woolwich , and by Dr . Gordon , the principal medical officer of the 2 : arrison , was altogether the clearest and most instructive that I had received , inasmuch as at the barracks and on the barrack field , about a mile from the river and at a considerable elevation , each variety of odour is perceptible . When the wind is in the north-west or north-north-east one variety is perceived , and when east - north-east the other variety . Dr . Gordon states that when travelling down the river from Woolwich to Purfleet he has recoo-nised the odour of the one variety when passing the manure works of Messrs . Lawes at Barking Creek , and that of the other when passing the works of Messrs . Bevington and Messrs . Brown in Erith Marshes . The odour from the last-named works he compares to that which he has perceived in India when passing to leeward of the places in which the Hindoos consume , by an imperfect cremation , the bodies of their dead . The odour is putrid as well as sickening . A north-east wind would bring effluvia towards the barracks from Barking Creek , distant 2 miles , while a more easterly wind would bring those from Ei-ith Marshes , distant 4 ^ miles . In the village of Plumstead , also , there are two varieties of odour perceived , according as the wind is in the north or hi the north-east ; the one wind blowing from the direction of Barking Creek , distant 2 miles , and the other from the direction of Erith Marshes , distant 3 miles . The Manager of the Southern Outfall Pumping Station also distino \\' uishes two varieties of offensive odour , according as the wind is in the east , bringing efflnvia which he describes as intolerably offensive , from the direction of the glue and manure works of Messrs . Brown and Messrs . Bevington , about half a-mile lower down the river ; or in the west , bringing effluvia from Barking Creek , distant about 2 miles ( no factory , giving rise to offensive effluvia , intervening . ) On the other hand , at Charlton , it appears , from the statements of the Inspectors of Nusiances , that only one variety of offensive odour is the subject of complaint , that it is of an acid and sickening character , and is perceived only when the wind is in the north-west , and , therefore ; blowing from the direction of a group of factories on the north shore near the Victoria Docks , and from some factories on the opposite or south shore and situated in Greenwich Marshes . It thus became necessary that I should inspect the several factories between Blackwall Reach to the west , and Erith Reach to the east . I have marked upon a map , which I append to this Report , the situation of these factories . It will be seen , on reference to the map , \\' that they lie in three groups . Group 1 is situated on and near the shores of the river at Bugsby \\' s reach ; group 2 about Barking Creek , about 3 miles more to the east ; and group 3 about 2 or 3 miles still further to the east , about the bend of the river between Halfway Reach and Erith Reach . The effluvia from group 1 alone appear to be complained of by the inhabitants of Charlton ; the effluvia from groups 1 , 2 and 3 appear to annoy the garrison at Woolwich ; while those from groups 2 and 3 annoy the inhabitants of Plumstead village and of the little colony at the Southern Outfall Pumping Station . The total number of factories in the three groups is twenty-one . Group 1 consists of ten factories of various kinds , group 2 of four , and group 3 of seven factories . All of these factories are not equally offensive ; some give issue to effluvia only perceptible at a short distance from the works , while the effluvia from others are such as experience has shown may be carried by the wind to the distance of several miles . The observations made in my inspection of each group of factories were specially directed to ascertain the extent of the works , the duration of their existence , the character and amount of effiuvia proceeding from them , and the means in use for preventing the escape of offensive effluvia . Group 1 consists of the following establishments : — { a . ) On Greenwich Marshes , on the south side of the river — ( 1 . ) Mockford \\' s \\' \\' Ordnance Manure Works ( No . 1 on map ) . — Only established about six months . No work going on at the time of my visit . There were about 250 tons of shoddy on the premises , a considerable quantity of mineral phosphates , and over 5,000 tons of guano . It was stated that the materials intended to be used are guano , mineral phosphates , and sulphate of ammonia . It was stated further that probably oil of vitriol would also be manufactured . The arrangements for preventing the escape of offensive effluvia are very imperfect , but , inasmuch as but little work has been carried on at these premises up to the present time , the effluvia proceeding from them have probably had little to do with the complaints . ( 2 . ) Hiirs Oil of Vitriol and Manure Works ( No . 2 on map ) . — These works cover about three acres . They have been established here for thirty-eight years , but manures have only been manufactured here since 1856 . There are separate works adjoining the manure works for the manufacture of nitric acid , tartaric acid , and oxalic acid . ( a . ) The arrangements for preventing escape of acid fumes in the manufacture of oil of vitriol appear to be efficient , except at times when the denitrating chamber is being washed out , which is only occasionally , { h . ) The materials used in the manufacture of manures are shoddy , waste leather , dry bones , bone ash , and the refuse from sugar bakeries , coprolites , and mineral phosphates generally . Until quite lately , no means have been in use for preventing the escape of offensive effluvia into the atmosphere during the mixing of the materials , or subsequently on their discharge from Section2 . ( 1 . ) Messrs . Gihhs \" \\' Oil of Vitriol and Manure Works ( No . 3 on map ) . — Established here for twelve or fifteen years , { a . ) The materials burned for the manufacture of oil of vitriol are crude sulphur and pyrites . The burners have not been acting well , and the escape of sulphurous acid has been made a subject of complaint to the West Ham Sanitary Authority . Under the direction of the Medical Officer of Health , Mr . Drake , alterations have been made from time to time during the last two years , and are still being made , efficiency having not yet been secured . ( & . ) The materials said to be used in the manufacture of manure are dry bones , guano and mineral phosphates , sulphate of ammonia being added to some kinds of manure . The best practicable means , so far as my knowledge extends , of preventing the escape of offensive effluvia into the atmosphere from the mixer and the reception-pits are in use in this establishment . Except accidentally , I should very much doubt the extension of effluvia from these works to any considerable distance . ( 2 . ) Odanis Oil of Vitriol and Manure Works ( No . 4 on map ) . — Established here in 1851 . The premises cover a space of five or six acres . This is one of the largest manure establishments visited , { a , ) The materials burned for the manufacture of oil of vitriol , are crude sulphur and pyrites . The burners act efficiently , but at the time of my visit the Gay Lussac condensing tower was not acting perfectly , and hence acid fumes were escaping from the shaft at an elevation of about 100 feet . But the manager stated \\' that this was quite an accidental occurrence . ( l > . ) The materials said to be used for manure making are shoddy , dry blood , guano , dry bones , coprolites , and mineral phosphates generally . A very powerful pungent odour pervaded the part of the works devoted to manure making , accompanied by an empyreumatic odour , dne to the heating of a heap of shoddy . From the character of the materials used , and from my experience of similar manufactories , I am satisfied that very pungent and offensive effluvia must be given off in the manulacture of manures into which these materials enter as ingredients . No means whatever are in use in this establishment to intercept these effluvia from the atmosphere , to which there are free openings at all parts of the premises . ( 3 ) Duncan ^ H Sugar Bakery ( No . 5 on the map ) . — No suggestion was made that any offensive effluvia at any time proceeded from this establishment . ( 4 ) Farmer \\' s Oil of Vitriol and Manure Works ( No . 6 on map ) . — Established about f ^ NO , years . The works are said to cover three acres , but the buildings do not appear to cover nearly this space . The works are not on a very extensive scale . { a . ) Crude sulphur and pyrites are burned for the manufacture of the oil of vitriol . Some of the burners act badly , so far as the escape of sulphurous acid on opening the feeding doors is concerned . Others , which have been altered in a manner suggested by Mr . Drake , the Medical Officer of Health for West Ham , act very efficiently in this respect : otherwise this part of the works appears unexceptional . Any acid fumes which may escape condensation in the Gay Lussac tower are discharged at an elevation of 110 feet , { h . ) The materials used for the manufacture of manure are said to be dry bones , coprolites , and mineral phosphates generally . Occasionally a little dried blood or sulphate of ammonia are added , but not in the mixer . Some means are in use to prevent the escape of effluvia into the premises from the mixer and receiving pit , but the object sought is to discharge them from the shaft at an elevation of 110 feet , from whence they may travel a long distance through the atmosphere . The best practicable means of preventing nuisance from the works have been adopted . ( 5 ) Walmsley \\' s Malt Roasting Works ( No . 7 on map ) , — An empyreumatic odour is said to proceed from these works occasionally , but this is only about twice a day , when the cylinders are emptied . The effluvia has never been made a vSubject • of complaint , and probably do not extend to any considerable distance . ( 6 . ) Shroeder and Ooinpanifs Oil of Vitriol and Manure Works ( No . 8 on map ) . — These works have only quite recently been established , and indeed part of the buildings are still in course of construction . The only manure made here is prepared by the mixing of guano and oil of vitriol in an open tank . The effluvia arising from this admixture are comparatively inconsiderable , but such as they are , no means have been adopted for preventing their escape freely into the atmosphere outside the sheds . Still it is not at all probable that these works have had any part in occasioning the nuisance complained of . The next works in the group are at the distance of halfa-mile to the eastward of those last mentioned . ( 7 ) Burt , Boulton , and Hay wards Tar Works ( No . 9 on map ) . — Established here three years . The works cover a space of eleven acres . The crude material dealt with is coal tar , which , as received , contains more or Jess admixture with it of ammoniacal liquor . The process adopted consists at first in the fractional distillation of the tar , the distillates being subsequently dealt with for the manufacture upon the premises of anthracine , carbolic acid , benzole , & c . Much care is taken to prevent the escape of offensive effluvia by the reception of the various products of the distillation while hot into covered receptacles . The only source of offensive effluvia has been the hot pitch as first run off from the stills ; but means are now being adopted to prevent nuisance from this source in future ; these means are of • a nature which , it appears to me are likely to be successful . It is quite possible that the vapours from the hot pitch may from time to time have reached the opposite shore of the Thames , mixed with the effluvia from manure works . But these vapours , the odour of which is peculiar and very different from the odour proceeding from manure works , do not appear to have been distinguished by the inhabitants at Charlton . ( 8 . ) Wooers Oil of Vitriol Works ( Xo . 10 on map ) . — These premises have recently changed hands , and no work was being done at the time of my visit . The Inspector of Nuisances at Charlton , however , states that on one occasion he distinctly traced the pungent odour of sulphurous acid across the river to these works . It is intended shortly to manufacture manure here . Group 2 consists of the following establishments , all on the Essex side , about Barking Creek . ( 1 . ) The Beckton Gas Works ( No . 11 on map ) . — Situated near the northern outfall sewer on the western side of the creek , not far from its mouth . They cover a space of thirty acres . The purification is effected by dry lime and by oxide of iron , and the purifiers are constructed upon the best principles . There is no reason to believe that any effluvia from these works reach the places on the south side of the river where complaints have been made . Section 3 . ( 3 . ) Lawes \\' \\' Oil of Vitriol and Manure Works ( No . 13 on mapj . — Established here eighteen or nineteen years , during which time they have undergone extension from time to time . The works cover three or four acres , and have a river frontage of continuous buildings to the extent of 200 yards . It is the largest manufactory of manure which I visited . Along the whole river front the pungent odour from the buildings was strongly marked , and the vapours proceeding from the sheds were irritating to the eyes as well as offensive to the smell . The works were everywhere pervaded within by the same odour . ( a . ) The materials burned for the manufacture of oil of \" vitriol , are crude sulphur , pyrites , and spent oxide from the gas works . So far as I was able to observe , the burners acted well . There is no Gay Lussac tower at these works , nor are any other means in use to intercept the waste gas passing from the leaden chambers . These gases are discharged into a shaft which delivers them into the external atmosphere at an elevation of 110 feet , ( b . ) The materials used in the manufacture of manure are said to be shoddy , a little waste leather , guano , dried bones , coprolites and mineral phosphates generally , and sulphate of ammonia . Up to the present time no proper means have been taken to prevent the escape of the irritating acid , offensive effluvia given off from the mixers , reception-pits , and accumulations of manure into the atmosphere outside the works . But recently these works have come into the hands of a Com pany , and the new manager is now engaged in erecting apparatus for the prevention of nuisance . 1 am not satisfied , however , that the means he is adopting will prove successful . These works are much complained of by the Manager of the Beckton Gas Works , who says that on Sundays they are especially offensive . These are the works which Dr . Gordon recognised as giving off the odours per ceived at the barracks at Woolwich when the wind is north-east ; nor have I any doubt that they are one of the sources of the nuisance complained of at Plumstead village . ( 4 . ) Crow \\' s Tar Works ( No . 14 on map ) . — Established here as a sulphate of ammonia works for sixteen years . The tar business was formerly carried on to a less extent than it is now . The tar is ( as in other tar works mentioned ) subjected to fractional distillation , and no sufficient means are in use to prevent the escape into the atmosphere of offensive vapours from the distillates aud from the hot pitch . Part of the \" light oil \" is rectified on the premises , and anthracene is also manufactured . Otherwise all the first products are sent away from the premises in casks . It is scarcely probable , however , that these works occasion any nuisance to the inhabitants of Plumstead . In the manu - * facture of sulphate of ammonia from ammoniacal liquor , means are in use to prevent the escape of sulphuretted hydrogen into the atmosphere . Group 3 consists of the following establishments : — ( a ) On the south side of Erith Marshes . ( 1 ) Bevington \\' s Manicre Works ( No . 15 on map . ) — Situated about half - a - mile from the Southern Outfall Pumping Station . These works are small , but have been established several years . The material used is \" scutch , \" which is the refuse matter left in the pans in which glue is made . This material is heated in closed pans by steam , with the addition of oil of vitriol , and there is an arrangement for condensing the vapours which proceed from the pans . Fat is first skimmed off , and the residue , after boiling about three hours , is run off into \\' \\' delves \" or trenches about four feet deep , dug into the earth outside the works : these ^ \\' delves \" are worked alternately . Up to about twelve months ago the pans employed were open . The manure which runs as a semi - liquid material into the \" delves \" solidifies in them after a time , partly by evaporation and partly by soakage of the more watery parts into the earth . When sufficiently firm the manure is dug out and dried by spreading it on heated plates , or by heating it over semicircular brick-flues . The effluvia from these stoves or flues are very offensive indeed , and escape freely into the external atmosphere . The odour , which resembles that of cheese when very much decomposed , pervades the works and their neighbourhood . ( 2 ) Broimi \\' s Glue and Manure Works ( No . 16 on map ) are carried on in premises adjoining Bevington \\' s . These works have been established a great many years , during which they have been a constant source of nuisance to persons passing up and down the river . Two manufactures are carried on here . One is that of glue from the clii ^ pings of hides used by tanners , horses \\' hoofs , & c . These matters arrive at the works in a more or less putrid condition , and no means whatever are in use to prevent the escape of the highly offensive vapour from the pans in which they are boiled into the atmosphere outside the works . The offensiveness of the vapour would naturally vary with the degree of decomposition of the material boiled . The \" scutch \" which remains after the making of the glue , is dealt with as at Bevington \\' s Works , the only difference being that no means are in use here to condense the vapour proceeding from the pans in which the \\' \\' scutch \" is heated with acid . These works are the most offensive upon the river , and the putrid sickening odour from thein travels for many miles . It has been distinctly recognized by the Manager of the Beckton Gas Works at his residence , a distance of three miles , and also by Dr . Gordon at the Woolwjch Barracks , a distance of about four miles . ( 3 . ) Prices Oil Refiner ij Works ( No . 17 on map ) . Established here nine years . The premises altogether cover ten acres , but only a portion of this space is covered by the buildings . Various oils are lefined here , such as fish oil , rape oil , Rangoon oil , and American oil . The odour from these works onlv extends to a short distance from them . Bi-sulphide of carbon is also made here , but no offensive smell is recognizable in or about the part of the works devoted to this manufacture . ( 6 . ) On the north side . ( 4 . j Miller and Jolmsoiis Oil of Vitriol and Manure Works ( No . 21 on map ) . — Established in March , 1872 . They cover an extent of one-and-a-half acres , { a . ) Pyrites alone used to burn as a source of sulphurous acid The Avaste gases from the leaden chamber pass into a condensing apparatus supplied with steam . This is not the best method of condensation . ( / > . ) The materials used for the manufacture of manure , are dry blood , bones , shoddy , coprolites , and mineral phosphates generally . The mixers and receiving pits are simply ventilated by a pipe which conducts the vapours through the roof into the external air . As these works extend they mil certainly become a source of nuisance , even if they are not so now , unless proper means be adopted to intercept the offensive vapours necessarily generated in the process . ( 5 . ) Wilson \\' \\' s Oil of Vitriol aiid Manure WorLs ( No . 20 on map ) . — Established about four years , ( a . ) Pyrites are used as the source of sulphur . The waste gases from the leaden chamber escape at once into the external atmosphere , no condensing apparatus whatever being in use . ( J ) . ) The materials used for manure making are fish , shoddy , guano , coprolites , and mineral phosphates generally . No means are in use to prevent the free escape of the offensive vapours generated into the external atmosphere . ( 6 ) Neivman and Company \\' s Candle Works ( No . 19 on map ) . — No work was going on at these premises at the time of my visit . I was informed by the Manager that the materials used are palm oil , tallow and bone fat . Some of these fats are distilled , and the products of the distillation condensed . A strong empyreumatic odour pervaded the works , but I have no means of knowing how far it would travel . ( 7 . ) Borell and HaganHs Manure Works ( No . 18 on map . ) — Adjoins the works last mentioned . There was no one on the premises at the time of my visit , but from what I observed it was evident that \" scutch \" manure was made , and that no means were in use to prevent the escape of offensive effluvia . To sum up the inferences I draw from the observation made during my inspection of the above works ^ I may say ^ that — ( 1 . ) It is tolerably certain that the offensive effluvia complained of bv the inhabitants of Charlton aud it & vicinity , have proceeded from the works upon Greenwich . Marshes , and from the other manure works in group 1 . Perhaps at various times , or occasionally , other effluvia from other works than the manure works , have assisted to create the nuisance complained of . Probably also the principal sources of nuisance have been Hill \\' s Works on Greenwich Marshes and Odam \\' s Works on the opposite side of the river . ( 2 . ) It is tolerably certain that the effluvia complained of as proceeding from the direction of Barking Creek , have issued mainly from the manure works of Messrs . Lawes . ( 3 ) It is absolutely certain that the putrid sickening odour proceeding from the direction of group 3 has issued mainly from the glue and manure works of Messrs . Brown and Messrs . Bevington on Erith Marshes . Perhaps , from time to time , other effluvia have been added from the manure works on the opposite shore of the river . With respect to the influence exerted upon the health of the persons who have been exposed to these offensive effluvia , and who complain of them as nuisances , little can be said of a very definite nature . JN ^ either . Dr . Finch nor Dr , Wise , both of whom stated it as their opinion that the effluvia were injurious to health , could furnish me with any specific information upon this subject . I am aAvare of no evidence that the workmen employed in artificial manure works suffer in any way from disease referable to the nature of their occupation . Nevertheless , delicate persons , and even some healthy persons , are very susceptible to the influence of sickening odours , such as those given off from the works complained of . Such persons are \" upset \" by them , made sick or nauseated , and , to such an extent as this , may be said to have their health disturbed . Dr . Gordon stated to me in conversation that , in the event of any severe epidemic occurring , evil would , in his opinion , probably result from these nuisances , on the principle that anything which \\' \\' upsets \" the nervous system predisposes an individual to suiter . This is , perhaps , as much as can be said upon the subject , except that it may be added that , during the prevalence of the winds which carry foul odours with them , householders prefer to keep their doors and windows closed at the cost of insufficient ventilation of their dwellings . Section4 . In the first place , I am of opinion that the complaints made by the inhabitants of Charlton and the adjoining parishes , and by the Sanitary Committee of the Woolwich garrison , of offensive smells , are well foimded . Two varieties of odour were described to me , both of which were said to be sickening , but the one more distinctly acid than the other , and the one or the other was said to be perceived according to the direction of the wind . But all parts of the district from which the complaints issued do not suffer equally from both varieties of odour . It appeared further , that the more elevated parts , at a greater or less distance from the shore of the river , sutler more than those parts which are situated at a lower level and nearer to the shore . The description given me by the Commandant at Woolwich , and by Dr . Gordon , the principal medical officer of the 2 : arrison , was altogether the clearest and most instructive that I had received , inasmuch as at the barracks and on the barrack field , about a mile from the river and at a considerable elevation , each variety of odour is perceptible . When the wind is in the north-west or north-north-east one variety is perceived , and when east - north-east the other variety . Dr . Gordon states that when travelling down the river from Woolwich to Purfleet he has recoo-nised the odour of the one variety when passing the manure works of Messrs . Lawes at Barking Creek , and that of the other when passing the works of Messrs . Bevington and Messrs . Brown in Erith Marshes . The odour from the last-named works he compares to that which he has perceived in India when passing to leeward of the places in which the Hindoos consume , by an imperfect cremation , the bodies of their dead . The odour is putrid as well as sickening . A north-east wind would bring effluvia towards the barracks from Barking Creek , distant 2 miles , while a more easterly wind would bring those from Ei-ith Marshes , distant 4 ^ miles . In the village of Plumstead , also , there are two varieties of odour perceived , according as the wind is in the north or hi the north-east ; the one wind blowing from the direction of Barking Creek , distant 2 miles , and the other from the direction of Erith Marshes , distant 3 miles . The Manager of the Southern Outfall Pumping Station also distino \\' uishes two varieties of offensive odour , according as the wind is in the east , bringing efflnvia which he describes as intolerably offensive , from the direction of the glue and manure works of Messrs . Brown and Messrs . Bevington , about half a-mile lower down the river ; or in the west , bringing effluvia from Barking Creek , distant about 2 miles ( no factory , giving rise to offensive effluvia , intervening . ) On the other hand , at Charlton , it appears , from the statements of the Inspectors of Nusiances , that only one variety of offensive odour is the subject of complaint , that it is of an acid and sickening character , and is perceived only when the wind is in the north-west , and , therefore ; blowing from the direction of a group of factories on the north shore near the Victoria Docks , and from some factories on the opposite or south shore and situated in Greenwich Marshes . It thus became necessary that I should inspect the several factories between Blackwall Reach to the west , and Erith Reach to the east . I have marked upon a map , which I append to this Report , the situation of these factories . It will be seen , on reference to the map , \\' that they lie in three groups . Group 1 is situated on and near the shores of the river at Bugsby \\' s reach ; group 2 about Barking Creek , about 3 miles more to the east ; and group 3 about 2 or 3 miles still further to the east , about the bend of the river between Halfway Reach and Erith Reach . The effluvia from group 1 alone appear to be complained of by the inhabitants of Charlton ; the effluvia from groups 1 , 2 and 3 appear to annoy the garrison at Woolwich ; while those from groups 2 and 3 annoy the inhabitants of Plumstead village and of the little colony at the Southern Outfall Pumping Station . The total number of factories in the three groups is twenty-one . Group 1 consists of ten factories of various kinds , group 2 of four , and group 3 of seven factories . All of these factories are not equally offensive ; some give issue to effluvia only perceptible at a short distance from the works , while the effluvia from others are such as experience has shown may be carried by the wind to the distance of several miles . The observations made in my inspection of each group of factories were specially directed to ascertain the extent of the works , the duration of their existence , the character and amount of effiuvia proceeding from them , and the means in use for preventing the escape of offensive effluvia . Group 1 consists of the following establishments : — { a . ) On Greenwich Marshes , on the south side of the river — ( 1 . ) Mockford \\' s \\' \\' Ordnance Manure Works ( No . 1 on map ) . — Only established about six months . No work going on at the time of my visit . There were about 250 tons of shoddy on the premises , a considerable quantity of mineral phosphates , and over 5,000 tons of guano . It was stated that the materials intended to be used are guano , mineral phosphates , and sulphate of ammonia . It was stated further that probably oil of vitriol would also be manufactured . The arrangements for preventing the escape of offensive effluvia are very imperfect , but , inasmuch as but little work has been carried on at these premises up to the present time , the effluvia proceeding from them have probably had little to do with the complaints . ( 2 . ) Hiirs Oil of Vitriol and Manure Works ( No . 2 on map ) . — These works cover about three acres . They have been established here for thirty-eight years , but manures have only been manufactured here since 1856 . There are separate works adjoining the manure works for the manufacture of nitric acid , tartaric acid , and oxalic acid . ( a . ) The arrangements for preventing escape of acid fumes in the manufacture of oil of vitriol appear to be efficient , except at times when the denitrating chamber is being washed out , which is only occasionally , { h . ) The materials used in the manufacture of manures are shoddy , waste leather , dry bones , bone ash , and the refuse from sugar bakeries , coprolites , and mineral phosphates generally . Until quite lately , no means have been in use for preventing the escape of offensive effluvia into the atmosphere during the mixing of the materials , or subsequently on their discharge from Section2 . materials said to be used in the manufacture of manure are dry bones , guano and mineral phosphates , sulphate of ammonia being added to some kinds of manure . The best practicable means , so far as my knowledge extends , of preventing the escape of offensive effluvia into the atmosphere from the mixer and the reception-pits are in use in this establishment . Except accidentally , I should very much doubt the extension of effluvia from these works to any considerable distance . ( 2 . ) Odanis Oil of Vitriol and Manure Works ( No . 4 on map ) . — Established here in 1851 . The premises cover a space of five or six acres . This is one of the largest manure establishments visited , { a , ) The materials burned for the manufacture of oil of vitriol , are crude sulphur and pyrites . The burners act efficiently , but at the time of my visit the Gay Lussac condensing tower was not acting perfectly , and hence acid fumes were escaping from the shaft at an elevation of about 100 feet . But the manager stated \\' that this was quite an accidental occurrence . ( l > . ) The materials said to be used for manure making are shoddy , dry blood , guano , dry bones , coprolites , and mineral phosphates generally . A very powerful pungent odour pervaded the part of the works devoted to manure making , accompanied by an empyreumatic odour , dne to the heating of a heap of shoddy . From the character of the materials used , and from my experience of similar manufactories , I am satisfied that very pungent and offensive effluvia must be given off in the manulacture of manures into which these materials enter as ingredients . No means whatever are in use in this establishment to intercept these effluvia from the atmosphere , to which there are free openings at all parts of the premises . ( 3 ) Duncan ^ H Sugar Bakery ( No . 5 on the map ) . — No suggestion was made that any offensive effluvia at any time proceeded from this establishment . ( 4 ) Farmer \\' s Oil of Vitriol and Manure Works ( No . 6 on map ) . — Established about f ^ NO , years . The works are said to cover three acres , but the buildings do not appear to cover nearly this space . The works are not on a very extensive scale . { a . ) Crude sulphur and pyrites are burned for the manufacture of the oil of vitriol . Some of the burners act badly , so far as the escape of sulphurous acid on opening the feeding doors is concerned . Others , which have been altered in a manner suggested by Mr . Drake , the Medical Officer of Health for West Ham , act very efficiently in this respect : otherwise this part of the works appears unexceptional . Any acid fumes which may escape condensation in the Gay Lussac tower are discharged at an elevation of 110 feet , { h . ) The materials used for the manufacture of manure are said to be dry bones , coprolites , and mineral phosphates generally . Occasionally a little dried blood or sulphate of ammonia are added , but not in the mixer . Some means are in use to prevent the escape of effluvia into the premises from the mixer and receiving pit , but the object sought is to discharge them from the shaft at an elevation of 110 feet , from whence they may travel a long distance through the atmosphere . The best practicable means of preventing nuisance from the works have been adopted . ( 5 ) Walmsley \\' s Malt Roasting Works ( No . 7 on map ) , — An empyreumatic odour is said to proceed from these works occasionally , but this is only about twice a day , when the cylinders are emptied . The effluvia has never been made a vSubject • of complaint , and probably do not extend to any considerable distance . ( 6 . ) Shroeder and Ooinpanifs Oil of Vitriol and Manure Works ( No . 8 on map ) . — These works have only quite recently been established , and indeed part of the buildings are still in course of construction . The only manure made here is prepared by the mixing of guano and oil of vitriol in an open tank . The effluvia arising from this admixture are comparatively inconsiderable , but such as they are , no means have been adopted for preventing their escape freely into the atmosphere outside the sheds . Still it is not at all probable that these works have had any part in occasioning the nuisance complained of . The next works in the group are at the distance of halfa-mile to the eastward of those last mentioned . ( 7 ) Burt , Boulton , and Hay wards Tar Works ( No . 9 on map ) . — Established here three years . The works cover a space of eleven acres . The crude material dealt with is coal tar , which , as received , contains more or Jess admixture with it of ammoniacal liquor . The process adopted consists at first in the fractional distillation of the tar , the distillates being subsequently dealt with for the manufacture upon the premises of anthracine , carbolic acid , benzole , & c . Much care is taken to prevent the escape of offensive effluvia by the reception of the various products of the distillation while hot into covered receptacles . The only source of offensive effluvia has been the hot pitch as first run off from the stills ; but means are now being adopted to prevent nuisance from this source in future ; these means are of • a nature which , it appears to me are likely to be successful . It is quite possible that the vapours from the hot pitch may from time to time have reached the opposite shore of the Thames , mixed with the effluvia from manure works . But these vapours , the odour of which is peculiar and very different from the odour proceeding from manure works , do not appear to have been distinguished by the inhabitants at Charlton . ( 8 . ) Wooers Oil of Vitriol Works ( Xo . 10 on map ) . — These premises have recently changed hands , and no work was being done at the time of my visit . The Inspector of Nuisances at Charlton , however , states that on one occasion he distinctly traced the pungent odour of sulphurous acid across the river to these works . It is intended shortly to manufacture manure here . Group 2 consists of the following establishments , all on the Essex side , about Barking Creek . ( 1 . ) The Beckton Gas Works ( No . 11 on map ) . — Situated near the northern outfall sewer on the western side of the creek , not far from its mouth . They cover a space of thirty acres . The purification is effected by dry lime and by oxide of iron , and the purifiers are constructed upon the best principles . There is no reason to believe that any effluvia from these works reach the places on the Section 3 . during which time they have undergone extension from time to time . The works cover three or four acres , and have a river frontage of continuous buildings to the extent of 200 yards . It is the largest manufactory of manure which I visited . Along the whole river front the pungent odour from the buildings was strongly marked , and the vapours proceeding from the sheds were irritating to the eyes as well as offensive to the smell . The works were everywhere pervaded within by the same odour . ( a . ) The materials burned for the manufacture of oil of \" vitriol , are crude sulphur , pyrites , and spent oxide from the gas works . So far as I was able to observe , the burners acted well . There is no Gay Lussac tower at these works , nor are any other means in use to intercept the waste gas passing from the leaden chambers . These gases are discharged into a shaft which delivers them into the external atmosphere at an elevation of 110 feet , ( b . ) The materials used in the manufacture of manure are said to be shoddy , a little waste leather , guano , dried bones , coprolites and mineral phosphates generally , and sulphate of ammonia . Up to the present time no proper means have been taken to prevent the escape of the irritating acid , offensive effluvia given off from the mixers , reception-pits , and accumulations of manure into the atmosphere outside the works . But recently these works have come into the hands of a Com pany , and the new manager is now engaged in erecting apparatus for the prevention of nuisance . 1 am not satisfied , however , that the means he is adopting will prove successful . These works are much complained of by the Manager of the Beckton Gas Works , who says that on Sundays they are especially offensive . These are the works which Dr . Gordon recognised as giving off the odours per ceived at the barracks at Woolwich when the wind is north-east ; nor have I any doubt that they are one of the sources of the nuisance complained of at Plumstead village . ( 4 . ) Crow \\' s Tar Works ( No . 14 on map ) . — Established here as a sulphate of ammonia works for sixteen years . The tar business was formerly carried on to a less extent than it is now . The tar is ( as in other tar works mentioned ) subjected to fractional distillation , and no sufficient means are in use to prevent the escape into the atmosphere of offensive vapours from the distillates aud from the hot pitch . Part of the \" light oil \" is rectified on the premises , and anthracene is also manufactured . Otherwise all the first products are sent away from the premises in casks . It is scarcely probable , however , that these works occasion any nuisance to the inhabitants of Plumstead . In the manu - * facture of sulphate of ammonia from ammoniacal liquor , means are in use to prevent the escape of sulphuretted hydrogen into the atmosphere . Group 3 consists of the following establishments : — ( a ) On the south side of Erith Marshes . ( 1 ) Bevington \\' s Manicre Works ( No . 15 on map . ) — Situated about half - a - mile from the Southern Outfall Pumping Station . These works are small , but have been established several years . The material used is \" scutch , \" which is the refuse matter left in the pans in which glue is made . This material is heated in closed pans by steam , with the addition of oil of vitriol , and there is an arrangement for condensing the vapours which proceed from the pans . Fat is first skimmed off , and the residue , after boiling about three hours , is run off into \\' \\' delves \" or trenches about four feet deep , dug into the earth outside the works : these ^ \\' delves \" are worked alternately . Up to about twelve months ago the pans employed were open . The manure which runs as a semi - liquid material into the \" delves \" solidifies in them after a time , partly by evaporation and partly by soakage of the more watery parts into the earth . When sufficiently firm the manure is dug out and dried by spreading it on heated plates , or by heating it over semicircular brick-flues . The effluvia from these stoves or flues are very offensive indeed , and escape freely into the external atmosphere . The odour , which resembles that of cheese when very much decomposed , pervades the works and their neighbourhood . ( 2 ) Broimi \\' s Glue and Manure Works ( No . 16 on map ) are carried on in premises adjoining Bevington \\' s . These works have been established a great many years , during which they have been a constant source of nuisance to persons passing up and down the river . Two manufactures are carried on here .

This is , perhaps , as much as can be said upon the subject , except that it may be added that , during the prevalence of the winds which carry foul odours with them , householders prefer to keep their doors and windows closed at the cost of insufficient ventilation of their dwellings . It may be distinguished from them by its very acid taste and its shape , which is that of needle-formed crystals , each of which , if put into a drop of ink , will turn it to a reddish brown , whereas Epsom salts will not change its colour at all . When a large dose of this poison has been taken , death takes place very quickly indeed . Symptoms produced in those who have swallowed it . A hot , burning , acid taste is felt in the act of swallowing , and vomiting of a greenish-brown fluid is produced , sooner or later , according to the quantity and strength of the poison taken . There is great tenderness felt over the stomach , followed by clammy perspirations and convulsions ; the legs are often drawn up , and there is generally stupor , from which the patient , however , can easily be roused , and always great prostration of strength . The pulse is small and weak , and the breathing faint . — Treatment . Chalk or magnesia , made into a cream with water , should be given in large quantities , and afterwards the emetic draught above prescribed , or some mustard-and-water , if the draught cannot be got . The back part of the throat to be tickled with a feather , to induce vomiting . Arrowroot , gruel , and the like drinks , are to be taken . When the prostration of strength is very great and the body cold , warmth is to be applied to it , and a little brandy-and-water , or sal-volatile and water , given . 2653 . Prussic Acid ( a thin , transparent , and colourless liquid , with a peculiar smell , which greatly resembles that of bitter almonds ) . — Symptoms produced in those who have swallowed it . These come on immediately after the poison has been taken , and may be produced by merely smelling it . The patient becomes perfectly insensible , and falls down in convulsions—his eyes are fixed and staring , the pupils being bigger than natural , the skin is cold and clammy , the pulse scarcely perceptible , and the breathing slow and gasping . — Treatment . Very little can be done in these cases , as death takes place so quickly after the poison has been swallowed , when it takes place at all . The best treatment—which should always be adopted in all cases , even though the patient appears quite dead-is to dash quantities of cold water on the back , from the top of the neck downwards . Placing the patient under a pump , and pumping on him , is the best way of doing this . Smelling-salts are also to be applied to the nose , and the chest well rubbed with a camphor liniment . 2654 . ALKALIS : Potash , Soda , and Ammonia , or common Smelling-Salts , with their principal preparations—Pearlash , Soap Lees , Liquor Potassae , Nitre , Sal Prunella , Hartshorn , and Sal—Volatile . — Alkalis are seldom taken or given with the view of destroying life . They may , however , be swallowed by mistake . — Symptoms produced in those who have swallowed them . There is at first a burning , acrid taste in , and a sensation of tightness round , the throat , like that of strangling ; the skin touched is destroyed ; retching mostly followed by actual vomiting , then sets in ; the vomited matters often containing blood of a dark brown colour , with little shreds of flesh here and there , and always changing vegetable blue colours green . There is now great tenderness over the whole of the belly . After a little while , great weakness , with cold , clammy sweats , a quick weak pulse , and purging of bloody matters , takes place . The brain , too , mostly becomes affected . — Treatment . Give two tablespoonfuls of vinegar or lemon-juice in a glassful of water every few minutes until the burning sensation is relieved . Any kind of oil or milk may also be given , and will form soap when mixed with the poison in the stomach . Barley-water , gruel , arrowroot , linseed-tea , & c . , are also very useful , and should be taken constantly , and in large quantities . If inflammation should take place , it is to be treated by applying leeches and warm poppy fomentations to the part where the pain is most felt , and giving two tablespoonfuls of the fever mixture every four hours . The diet in all these cases should only consist of arrowroot or gruel for the first few days , and then of weak broth or beef-tea for some time after . 2655 . When very strong fumes of smelling-salts have in any way been inhaled , there is great difficulty of breathing , and alarming pain in the mouth and nostrils . In this case let the patient inhale the steam of warm vinegar , and treat the feverish symptoms as before . It seems highly probable that , as has been especially emphasized by Hagen , perfumes were primitively used by women , not as is sometimes the case in civilization , with the idea of disguising any possible natural odor , but with the object of heightening and fortifying the natural odor . If the primitive man was inclined to disparage a woman whose odor was slight or imperceptible , — turning away from her with contempt , as the Polynesian turned away from the ladies of Sydney : \" They have no smell ! \" — women would inevitably seek to supplement any natural defects in this respect , and to accentuate their odorous qualities , in the same way as by corsets and bustles , even in civilization , they have sought to accentuate the sexual saliencies of their bodies . In this way we may , as Hagen suggests , explain the fact that until recent times the odors preferred by women have not been the most delicate or exquisite , but the strongest , the most animal , the most sexual : musk , castoreum , civet , and ambergris . In that interesting novel — dealing with the adventures of a Jewish maiden at the Persian court of Xerxes — which under the title of Esther has found its way into the Old Testament we are told that it was customary in the royal harem at Shushan to submit the women to a very prolonged course of perfuming before they were admitted to the king : \" six months with oil of myrrh and six months with sweet odors . \" { Esther , Chapter II , v . 12 . ) In the Arabian Nights there are many allusions to the use of perfumes by women with a more or less definitely stated aphrodisiacal intent . Thus we read in the story of Kamaralzaman : \" With fine incense I will perfume my breasts , my belly , my whole body , so that my skin may melt more sweetly in thy mouth , O apple of my eye ! \" Even among savages the perfuming of the body is sometimes practiced with the object of inducing love in the partner . Schellong states that the Papuans of Kaiser Wilhelm\\'s Land rub various fragrant plants into their bodies for this purpose . { Zeitschrift fur Ethnologic , 1899 , ht . i , p . 19 . ) The significance of this practice is more fully revealed by Haddon when studying the Papuans of Torres Straits , among whom the initiative in courtship is taken by the women . It was by scenting himself with a pungent odorous substance that a young man indicated that he was ready to be sued by the girls . A man would wear this scent at the back of his neck during a dance in order to attract the attention of a particular girl ; it was believed to act with magical certainty , after the manner of a charm ( Reports of the Cambridge Anthropological Expedition to Torres Straits , vol . v , pp . 211 , 222 , and 328 ) . The perfume which is of all perfumes the most interesting from the present point of view is certainly musk . With ambergris , musk is the chief member of Linnseus \\' s group of Odores ambrosiacce , a group which in sexual significances , as Zwaardemaker remarks , ranks besides the capryl group of odors . It is a perfume of ancient origin ; its name is Persian 1 ( indicating doubtless the channel whence it reached Europe ) and ultimately derived from the Sanskrit word for testicle in allusion to the fact that it was contained in a pouch removed from the sexual parts of the male musk-deer . Musk odors , however , often of considerable strength , are very widely distributed in Nature , alike among animals and plants . This is indicated by the frequency with which the word \" musk \" forms part of the names of animals and plants which are by no means always nearly related . We have the musk-ox , the musky mole , several species called musk-rat , the musk-duck , the muskbeetle ; while among plants which have received their names from a real or supposed musky odor are , besides several that are called musk-plant , the musk-rose , the musk-hyacinth , the musk-mallow , the musk-orchid , the musk-melon , the muskcherry , the musk-pear , the musk-plum , muskat and muscatels , musk-seed , musk-tree , musk-wood , etc . 2 But a musky odor is not merely widespread in Nature among plants and the lower animals , it is peculiarly associated with man . Incidentally we have already seen how it is regarded as characteristic of some races of man , especially the Chinese . Moreover , the smell of the negress is said to be musky in character , and among Europeans a musky odor is said to be characteristic of blondes . Laycock , in his Nervous Diseases of Women , stated his opinion that \" the musk odor is certainly the sexual odor of man \" ; and Fere states that the musk odor is that among natural perfumes most nearly approaching the odor of the sexual secretions . We have seen that the Chinese poet vaunts the musky odor of his mistress \\' s armpits , while another Oriental saying concerning the attractive woman is that \" her navel is filled with musk . \" Persian literature contains many references to musk as an attractive body odor , and Firdusi speaks of a woman \\' s hair as \" a crown of musk , \" while the Arabian poet Motannabi says of his mistress that \" her hyacinthine hair smells sweeter than Scythian musk . \" Galopin stated that he knew women whose natural odor of musk ( and less frequently of ambergris ) was sufficiently strong to impart to a bath in less than an hour a perfume due entirely to the exhalations of the musky body ; it must be added that Galopin was an enthusiast in this matter . The special significance of musk from our present point of view lies not only in the fact that we here have a perfume , widely scattered throughout nature and often in an agreeable form , which is at the same time a very frequent personal odor in man . Musk is the odor which not only in the animals to which it has given a name , but in many others , is a specifically sexual odor , chiefly emitted during the sexual season . The sexual odors , indeed , of most animals seem to be modifications of musk . The Sphinx moth has a musky odor which is confined to the male and is doubtless sexual . Some lizards have a musky odor which is heightened at the sexual season ; crocodiles during the pairing season emit from their submaxillary glands a musky odor which pervades their haunts . In the same way elephants emit a musky odor from their facial glands during the rutting season . The odor of the musk-duck is chiefly confined to the breeding season . 1 The musky odor of the negress is said to be heightened during sexual excitement . The predominance of musk as a sexual odor is associated with the fact that its actual nervous influence , apart from the presence of sexual associations , is very considerable . Fere found it to be a powerful muscular stimulant . In former times musk enjoyed a high reputation as a cardiac stimulant ; it fell into disuse , but in recent years its use in asthenic states has been revived , and excellent results , it has been claimed , have followed its administration in cases of collapse from Asiatic cholera . For sexual torpor in women it still has ( like vanilla and sandal ) a certain degree of reputation , though it is not often used , and some of the old Arabian physicians ( especially Avicenna ) recommended it , with castoreum and myrrh , for amenorrhoea . Its powerful action is indicated by the experience of Esquirol , who stated that he had seen cases in which sensory stimulation by musk in women during lactation had produced mania . It has always had the reputation , more especially in the Mohammedan East , of being a sexual stimulant to men ; \" the noblest of perfumes / \\' it is called in El Ktab , \" and that which most provokes to venery . \" Not only is musk the most cherished perfume of the Islamic world , and the special favorite of the Prophet himself , who greatly delighted in perfumes ( \" I love your world , \" he is reported to have said in old age , \" for its women and its perfumes \" ) , 1 it is the only perfume generally used by the women of a land in which the refinements of life have been carried so far as Japan , and they received it from the Chinese . 2 Moreover , musk is still the most popular of European perfumes . It is the perfumes containing musk , Piesse states in his well-known book on the Art of Perfumery , which sell best . It is certainly true that in its simple form the odor of musk is not nowadays highly considered in Europe . This fact is connected with the ever-growing refinement in accordance with which the specific odors of the sexual regions in human beings tend to lose their primitive attractiveness and bodily odors generally become mingled with artificial perfumes and so disguised . But , although musk in its simple form , and under its ancient name , has lost its hold in Europe , it is an interesting and significant fact that it is still the perfumes which contains musk that are the most widely popular . Peau d \\' Espagne may be mentioned as a highly complex and luxurious perfume , often the favorite scent of sensuous persons , which really owes a large part of its potency to the presence of the crude animal sexual odors of musk and civet . It consists of wash-leather steeped in ottos of neroli , rose , santal , lavender , verbena , bergamot , cloves , and cinnamon , subsequently smeared with civet and musk . It is said by some , probably with a certain degree of truth , that Peau d \\' Espagne is of all perfumes that which most nearly approaches the odor of a woman \\' s skin ; whether it also suggests the odor of leather is not so clear . There is , however , no doubt that the smell of leather has a curiously stimulating sexual influence on many men and women . It is an odor which seems to occupy an intermediate place between the natural body odors and the artificial perfumes for which it sometimes serves as a basis ; possibly it is to this fact that its occasional sexual influence is owing , for , as Ave have already seen , there is a tendency for sexual allurement to attach to odors which are not the specific personal body odors but yet are related to them . Moll considers , no doubt rightly , that shoe fetichism , perhaps the most frequent of sexual fetichistic perversions , is greatly favored , if , indeed , it does not owe its origin to , the associated odor of the feet and of the shoes . He narrates a case of shoe fetichism in a man in which the perversion began at the age of 6 , when for the first time he wore new shoes , having previously used only the left-off shoes of his elder brother ; he felt and smelt these new shoes with sensations of unmeasured pleasure ; and a few years later began to use shoes as a method of masturbation . ISTacke has also recorded the case of a shoe fetichist who declared that the sexual attraction of shoes ( usually his wife \\' s ) lay largely in the odor of the leather . Krafft-Ebing , again , brings forward a case of shoe fetichism in which the significant fact is mentioned that the subject bought a pair of leather cuffs to smell while masturbating . Eestif de la Bretonne , who was somewhat of a shoe fetichist , appears to have enjoyed smelling shoes . It is not probable that the odor of leather explains the whole of shoe fetichism , — as we shall see when , in another \" Study , \" this question comes before us — and in many cases it cannot be said to enter at all ; it is , however , one of the factors . Such a conclusion is further supported by the fact that by many the odor of new shoes is sometimes desired as an adjuvant to coitus . It is in the experience of prostitutes that such a device is not in - frequent . Niieke mentions that a colleague of his was informed by a prostitute that several of her clients desired the odor of new shoes in the room , and that she was accustomed to obtain the desired perfume by holding her shoes for a moment over the flame of a spirit lamp .']\n"
